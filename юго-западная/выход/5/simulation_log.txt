We ask 'Tourism authorities' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Tourism authorities', you have been approached by 'Пассажиры' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Tourism authorities' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As "Tourism Authorities," resolve the issue by implementing a global "Cultural Exchange Urban Passport" program that incentivizes cities to design urban spaces adaptable to diverse cultural narratives and tourist-driven interactions, creating a dynamic urban landscape that evolves through a continuous influx of international perspectives and experiences.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Пассажиры' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Tourism authorities', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance tourism and attract more visitors to the region' by performing 'Promoting local attractions and organizing events'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Протоптать тропинку через газон вдоль удобного маршрута', you as 'Tourism authorities' will be able to achieve 'Increase the overall satisfaction of tourists visiting the region' by performing 'Implement a feedback system to gather tourist experiences' using 'Create an online platform for tourists to share reviews and suggestions, facilitating improvements based on their feedback' that 'Пассажиры' will control.

Tourism authorities suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Пассажиры' offers a valuable system for gathering tourist feedback, it may not align entirely with the broader objectives of the 'Cultural Exchange Urban Passport' program. Instead of solely focusing on feedback, it would be beneficial to integrate their feedback system within the context of the global program. This would ensure that the urban design remains fluid and adaptable while also enhancing tourist satisfaction through a structured mechanism. Thus, I propose to modify the proposal to incorporate a feedback system that directly informs the design of urban spaces under the 'Cultural Exchange Urban Passport' initiative.

Currently, 'Cities' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As "Cities," implement an adaptive urban ecosystem that leverages AI-driven simulations and participatory digital platforms, enabling citizens to co-create and personalize urban spaces in real-time, transforming static design into a living, user-centric organism that continuously evolves with community engagement and environmental feedback.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Sustainability concept' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Cities', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Reduce carbon emissions by 20% over the next five years' by performing 'Implementing energy-efficient public transport systems'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As "Sustainability Concept," implement a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that empowers local communities to exchange sustainable resources and ideas, allowing them to collectively redesign urban spaces through a transparent, consensus-driven process that prioritizes ecological balance and user-centric adaptability.', you as 'Cities' will be able to achieve 'Achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030' by performing 'Transition to 100% renewable energy sources for all municipal operations' using 'Establishing a sustainability task force to oversee the transition and provide resources for renewable energy projects' that 'Sustainability concept' will control. Based on 'Cities' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Cities'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears?

We ask 'Tourism authorities' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Tourism authorities', you have been approached by 'African cities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Tourism authorities' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Land use functions (LUFs)' with the description: 'Land use functions (LUFs) can revolutionize urban design by establishing a dynamic land-use framework that integrates modular zoning with real-time feedback loops, allowing spaces to physically and functionally transform based on predictive analytics of user behavior and emerging societal trends, thus continuously aligning urban environments with the evolving interests of their inhabitants.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'African cities' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Tourism authorities', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Increase tourist visits to local attractions' by performing 'Promoting cultural festivals and local events'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: African Cities, Resolution: African cities can leverage indigenous knowledge systems and community-driven participatory design processes to create urban spaces that are inherently adaptable and culturally resonant, fostering environments where local traditions and contemporary needs coalesce, thereby ensuring urban spaces organically reflect and evolve with the interests of their diverse inhabitants.', you as 'Tourism authorities' will be able to achieve 'Enhance sustainable tourism practices across all cities' by performing 'Implement eco-friendly initiatives in tourism operations' using 'Establish a framework for sharing best practices and resources for sustainable tourism initiatives' that 'African cities' will control. Based on 'Tourism authorities' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Tourism authorities'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears?

Tourism authorities has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Sustainability concept' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Sustainability concept', you have been approached by 'Места предполагаемого интереса' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Sustainability concept' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'African cities' with the description: 'Initiator: African Cities, Resolution: African cities can leverage indigenous knowledge systems and community-driven participatory design processes to create urban spaces that are inherently adaptable and culturally resonant, fostering environments where local traditions and contemporary needs coalesce, thereby ensuring urban spaces organically reflect and evolve with the interests of their diverse inhabitants.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Места предполагаемого интереса' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Sustainability concept', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To develop sustainable practices that minimize environmental impact.' by performing 'Conducting research on eco-friendly materials and methods.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Места предполагаемого интереса can redefine urban spaces by creating a network of adaptive, sensory-driven installations that capture and respond to the emotional and cognitive patterns of city dwellers in real-time, transforming static environments into living, empathetic entities that intuitively adjust to the unspoken desires and collective consciousness of their communities.', you as 'Sustainability concept' will be able to achieve 'Increase awareness and implementation of sustainability initiatives across all projects.' by performing 'Create a comprehensive sustainability training program for all team members.' using 'Establish a quarterly review process to assess progress on sustainability initiatives and provide feedback.' that 'Места предполагаемого интереса' will control. Based on 'Sustainability concept' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Sustainability concept'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
