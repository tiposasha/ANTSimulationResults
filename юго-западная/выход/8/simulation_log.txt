Urban residents has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Sustainability concept' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Sustainability concept', you have been approached by 'Smart city' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Sustainability concept' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'African cities' with the description: 'As 'African cities', propose the establishment of an Afro-centric urban innovation lab that harnesses indigenous knowledge systems and community-led participatory design to create flexible urban spaces that adapt to local cultural expressions, economic activities, and environmental conditions, thereby ensuring urban environments are dynamically aligned with the authentic and evolving needs of their diverse user base.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Smart city' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Sustainability concept', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Reduce carbon emissions in urban areas by 30% by 2030' by performing 'Implementing renewable energy sources in public buildings'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Smart city', propose the implementation of an AI-driven urban feedback loop system that continuously collects and analyzes real-time data from city infrastructure, user interactions, and environmental factors to autonomously adapt and optimize urban spaces, ensuring they are perpetually aligned with the dynamic and diverse needs of all users while fostering sustainable urban growth.', you as 'Sustainability concept' will be able to achieve 'Achieve zero waste in the city by 2025' by performing 'Develop a comprehensive waste management and recycling program' using 'Establishing a public-private partnership to fund and manage waste reduction initiatives' that 'Smart city' will control. Based on 'Sustainability concept' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Sustainability concept'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
