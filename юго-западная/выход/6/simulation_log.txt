Cities suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Smart City' offers significant benefits in reducing carbon emissions and improving urban ecosystems, it lacks a strong emphasis on the cultural and community aspects that are crucial for 'Cities'. The previous resolution with 'African Cities' focuses on indigenous knowledge and community storytelling, which aligns more closely with the heritage and aspirations of urban inhabitants. Therefore, to make the proposal more appealing, it should incorporate elements that ensure community engagement and cultural narratives, allowing for a more holistic approach to urban development.

Cities declined the resolution proposed by Smart city with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Smart City' presents an interesting opportunity to achieve a significant reduction in carbon emissions, it does not align with the core values and aspirations of 'Cities', which emphasizes community storytelling and indigenous knowledge systems. Leaving the resolution with 'African Cities' would undermine the collaborative effort focused on cultural narratives and the dynamic evolution of urban environments. Therefore, the benefits of the 'Smart City' proposal do not sufficiently outweigh the importance of maintaining the current resolution.

If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Smart city' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Tourism authorities', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Increase tourist footfall and enhance visitor experiences in the city.' by performing 'Promoting local attractions through marketing campaigns and partnerships with travel agencies.'. However, under the proposed resolution '"Smart City" will introduce a bio-integrated urban ecosystem that leverages living architecture and responsive biosensors to create self-regulating urban environments, allowing city spaces to autonomously adapt and thrive in harmony with human activity and environmental changes, ensuring a perpetual alignment with the evolving needs and well-being of their inhabitants.', you as 'Tourism authorities' will be able to achieve 'Integrate smart technologies to provide real-time information and enhance tourist engagement.' by performing 'Implement a smart tourism app that offers personalized recommendations and navigational support.' using 'Establish a collaboration framework with tech developers and local businesses to co-create the smart tourism app and ensure its accessibility to all visitors.' that 'Smart city' will control. Based on 'Tourism authorities' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Tourism authorities'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
