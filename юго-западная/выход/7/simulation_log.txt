We ask 'Пассажиры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Пассажиры', you have been approached by 'Выход из метро' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'.

Пассажиры declined the resolution proposed by Выход из метро with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Выход из метро' introduces a dynamic underground network that adapts to real-time data and may offer personalized experiences, it does not directly address the desire for quick and convenient access to destinations. Additionally, it could potentially complicate the navigation and flow of commuters, leading to increased time spent maneuvering through this new system, which contradicts the fear of wasting time on obstacles. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the core desires and fears of 'Пассажиры'.

Tourism authorities has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Sustainability concept' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Sustainability concept', you have been approached by 'Выход из метро' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Sustainability concept' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Gastronomic trail' with the description: 'As 'Gastronomic trail', we propose to resolve the mismatch between pre-designed urban spaces and user interests by transforming urban environments into a mosaic of edible landscapes and sensory-rich culinary zones, where the integration of food cultivation, preparation, and consumption becomes a central, interactive component of urban life, allowing communities to reshape their spaces through the universal language of gastronomy, fostering cultural exchange, sustainability, and a deeper connection to place.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Выход из метро' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Sustainability concept', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Develop a sustainable urban transportation strategy' by performing 'Conducting research on eco-friendly transit options'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Выход из метро', we propose to resolve the mismatch between pre-designed urban spaces and user interests by creating an underground network of modular, adaptive spaces that unfold and transform in response to real-time commuter data, providing a dynamic, hidden layer of urban life that seamlessly integrates with above-ground environments, thus offering a flexible and personalized urban experience that evolves with the rhythm of the city's inhabitants.', you as 'Sustainability concept' will be able to achieve 'Implement a zero-emission metro system' by performing 'Transition existing metro trains to electric-powered systems' using 'Establishing a timeline for the transition and providing funding for the necessary infrastructure upgrades' that 'Выход из метро' will control. Based on 'Sustainability concept' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Sustainability concept'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

Tourism authorities has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Пассажиры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Пассажиры', you have been approached by 'Места предполагаемого интереса' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Пассажиры' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Пассажиры', we propose to resolve the mismatch between pre-designed urban spaces and user interests by introducing a participatory urban symbiosis model, where citizens and urban ecosystems co-evolve through a shared digital platform that empowers individuals to directly manipulate and adapt their immediate environments in real-time, fostering a living urban landscape that grows organically from the collective creativity and dynamic needs of its inhabitants.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Места предполагаемого интереса' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Пассажиры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Обеспечение комфортного и безопасного путешествия' by performing 'Следование установленным маршрутам и правилам'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Места предполагаемого интереса', we propose to resolve the mismatch between pre-designed urban spaces and user interests by creating a decentralized network of pop-up urban laboratories that utilize augmented reality and gamification to engage citizens in playful experimentation and co-creation of their environments, allowing for a constantly evolving urban tapestry that reflects the spontaneous desires and imaginative visions of its inhabitants.', you as 'Пассажиры' will be able to achieve 'Посещение мест предполагаемого интереса' by performing 'Организация экскурсий и остановок на интересных локациях' using 'Создание расписания с указанием мест предполагаемого интереса и времени остановок' that 'Места предполагаемого интереса' will control. Based on 'Пассажиры' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Быстро и удобно добираться до пунктов назначения. Your current fears: Тратить лишнее время на обход препятствий. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Пассажиры'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Пассажиры declined the resolution proposed by Места предполагаемого интереса with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Места предполагаемого интереса' offers a creative approach to urban engagement, it does not align with the primary desires of 'Пассажиры' for fast and convenient transportation to destinations. The focus on pop-up laboratories and gamification may introduce additional complexity and potential delays, which could contradict the goal of minimizing time spent navigating obstacles. Therefore, 'Пассажиры' would prefer a resolution that emphasizes efficiency and direct access to points of interest without added layers of experimentation.
