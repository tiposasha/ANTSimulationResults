Tourism authorities suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to increase accessibility for all demographics, including those with disabilities, aligns with the intention of promoting sustainable tourism and enhancing visitor experiences, it lacks the immersive, multi-sensory engagement that the initial resolution aims to achieve. Therefore, it is essential to modify the proposal to include elements of augmented reality and co-creation of narratives, ensuring that the urban experience is dynamic and culturally rich, while also addressing accessibility needs.

We ask 'Администрация' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Администрация', you have been approached by 'Tourism authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Администрация' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Cities' with the description: 'As 'Cities', create a decentralized urban design blockchain platform that empowers citizens to propose and vote on urban space modifications through a transparent and inclusive process, ensuring that urban development is directly shaped by the collective intelligence and desires of its inhabitants.'.

Your current fears: Недовольство граждан и критика их решений. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Администрация'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.
