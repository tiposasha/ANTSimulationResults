Resolution created by Tourism authorities: Initiator: Tourism Authorities, Resolution: Transform urban spaces into dynamic, culturally immersive experiences by integrating augmented reality tours and interactive installations that celebrate local heritage and attract global visitors, continuously reshaping urban environments to align with user interests while boosting tourism and community engagement.
Recruited participants: ['Администрация', 'Smart city', 'Менеджеры и дизайнеры, отвечавшие за ландшафт', 'Места предполагаемого интереса']
We ask 'Администрация' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Администрация', you have been approached by 'Tourism authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Администрация' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Sustainability concept' with the description: 'Establish a participatory urban design platform powered by AI and real-time data analytics, allowing residents to co-create and continuously adapt urban spaces to their evolving needs and preferences, ensuring sustainability and inclusivity.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Tourism authorities' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Администрация', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance local tourism infrastructure and services' by performing 'Conducting assessments of existing facilities and planning improvements'.

Your current fears: Недовольство граждан и критика их решений. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Администрация'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

Администрация suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Tourism authorities' aims to enhance local tourism infrastructure and engage users through augmented reality experiences, it does not adequately prioritize the direct needs and preferences of local residents. As 'Администрация', my primary desire is to improve the urban environment and meet the needs of citizens. Therefore, I propose to modify the resolution to ensure that resident feedback is not only collected but integrated into the planning process for these tourism initiatives. This approach would align with my goals of enhancing urban spaces while mitigating potential citizen dissatisfaction.

Smart city declined the resolution proposed by Tourism authorities with reasoning: While the proposal from the Tourism Authorities aims to enhance tourist satisfaction and engagement through smart solutions, it diverges from the current focus on participatory urban design and sustainability. Leaving the existing resolution could undermine efforts to create a more inclusive and adaptive urban environment that prioritizes resident needs. Therefore, maintaining the current resolution is more aligned with the long-term goals of 'Smart city' regarding sustainability and community involvement.

Smart city has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Пассажиры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Пассажиры', you have been approached by 'Выход из метро' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Заранее спроектированный дизайн урбанистических пространств не соответствует интересам пользователей'. Currently, 'Пассажиры' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Протоптать тропинку через газон вдоль удобного маршрута'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Выход из метро' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Пассажиры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Выйти из метро' by performing 'Дождаться открытия дверей вагона'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiate a "Metro Nexus Living Labs" program where exit points from metro stations become experimental hubs for community-driven urban innovation, allowing users to propose and test novel urban design concepts in real-time, transforming transit spaces into dynamic catalysts for adaptive urban transformation.', you as 'Пассажиры' will be able to achieve 'Ускорить выход из метро' by performing 'Следовать за указателями к выходу' using 'Установка дополнительных указателей и объявлений, информирующих о ближайших выходах' that 'Выход из метро' will control. Based on 'Пассажиры' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Быстро и удобно добираться до пунктов назначения. Your current fears: Тратить лишнее время на обход препятствий. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Пассажиры'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
