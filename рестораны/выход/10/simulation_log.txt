Туристы-клиенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the AI-driven review authentication system proposed by 'User' addresses the issue of fake reviews, it shifts the control of feedback and incentives away from 'Туристы-клиенты'. Maintaining a community-driven ecosystem is crucial for fostering trust. Therefore, a hybrid approach that combines the blockchain-powered loyalty program with elements of AI verification may provide a more balanced solution, allowing 'Туристы-клиенты' to retain influence while benefiting from enhanced authenticity and actionable insights.
