Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: customer
Reasoning: The entity 'Customers' encapsulates the diverse desires and fears expressed by the group, as they are the end users who seek reliable information, authentic reviews, and satisfactory experiences. Their concerns about being misled by fake reviews and their desire for accurate feedback directly reflect the overarching interests of those engaging in the review system.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: TripAdvisor ranking
Reasoning: TripAdvisor ranking best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it encapsulates the core desire for an accurate reflection of hotel quality and customer experiences based on genuine reviews. TripAdvisor is a widely recognized platform where user-generated content significantly influences consumer decisions in the hospitality industry. Additionally, the concerns regarding manipulation, fake reviews, and the need for a reliable reputation model are directly tied to how TripAdvisor ranks and displays accommodations, making it a focal point for both desires and fears related to review systems.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Restaurants
Reasoning: The entity 'Restaurants' best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it encompasses a wide range of stakeholders in the hospitality sector, including independent and chain restaurants. The desires and fears articulated are closely tied to the online reputation, customer reviews, and revenue impacts that are critical for restaurant operations. Restaurants face unique challenges in managing customer feedback and maintaining high ratings, which makes them a focal point for understanding the broader dynamics at play in the hospitality and tourism industry.

Resolution created by customer: As 'customer', I would propose a decentralized, blockchain-based review system where each review is verified through a consensus mechanism and tied to a unique digital identity, ensuring authenticity and accountability while incentivizing honest feedback with a token reward system.
Resolution created by TripAdvisor ranking: As 'TripAdvisor ranking', I would implement an AI-driven sentiment analysis tool that filters and highlights reviews based on emotional authenticity and consistency over time, rewarding frequent and reliable reviewers with exclusive travel insights and experiences, thus fostering a community of trust and credibility.
Resolution created by Restaurants: As 'Restaurants', we propose a dynamic, interactive dining experience where patrons can rate their meals in real-time through a secure, restaurant-provided app that uses biometric verification to ensure genuine feedback, while offering personalized menu recommendations and rewards for detailed, constructive reviews, thereby fostering a direct and transparent relationship between diners and restaurants.

Инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to create a platform for ranking the best restaurants and hotels based on user reviews aligns with my desire to invest in promising startups, it does not adequately address my fear of losing investments due to the potential for false information on the platform. To mitigate this risk, I recommend incorporating strict verification processes for user reviews and a robust system to monitor and manage the authenticity of feedback. This would enhance the credibility of the platform and provide a safer environment for investment.

Инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Три основателя стартапа with reasoning: While the proposed platform for ranking restaurants and hotels based on user reviews could potentially be a valuable venture, it poses significant risks that concern the credibility of information and the success of the platform. Given that my current fears include losing invested funds due to platform failure or misinformation, this proposal doesn't align with my desire for long-term returns. The focus on mentorship and funding control by the founders also raises concerns about the ability to influence the platform's success effectively.

TripAdvisor ranking suggested modifying the resolution text with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Три основателя стартапа' offers a compelling opportunity to increase visibility for new startups, it does not directly address the current controversy regarding fake reviews, which is critical for maintaining trust in the TripAdvisor platform. Modifying the resolution to incorporate features that enhance the credibility of reviews while also promoting startups will align both objectives, ensuring that the integrity of user reviews is upheld while fostering innovation and visibility for new businesses.
