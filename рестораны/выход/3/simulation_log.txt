Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: customer
Reasoning: The entity 'Customer' best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it encompasses a broad range of individuals who seek accurate information, reliable reviews, and positive experiences when making purchasing decisions. Customers are directly impacted by the quality of reviews, the credibility of information, and their overall satisfaction with products and services, making them central to the dynamics of online reviews and consumer trust.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: TripAdvisor ranking
Reasoning: TripAdvisor ranking serves as a critical touchpoint for consumers in the hospitality industry, encapsulating the desires for accurate reflection of hotel quality and customer experiences. It also embodies fears related to manipulation and reliability in review systems. Given its influence on consumer decisions and the necessity for trustworthy rankings, it effectively represents the collective interests and concerns regarding the authenticity and integrity of reviews.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: hotel property
Reasoning: The hotel property serves as the primary point of interaction for guests and is directly impacted by both positive and negative reviews. It encapsulates the interests and concerns of the group, as the quality of the property, service delivery, and overall guest experience are crucial for attracting customers and maintaining a good reputation. Additionally, the hotel property is the entity most affected by online ratings and reviews, making it a pivotal focus in the context of customer feedback and market competition.

Resolution created by customer: Create a decentralized, blockchain-based verification system for reviews, where customers are incentivized with digital tokens for providing authenticated, transparent feedback and collaborating in the detection of fraudulent activity.
Resolution created by TripAdvisor ranking: TripAdvisor Ranking could resolve the issue of fake reviews by implementing an AI-powered review authenticity scoring system that dynamically adjusts the visibility and influence of reviews based on their credibility, combined with a community-driven reporting mechanism to continuously refine and uphold the integrity of the review ecosystem.
Resolution created by hotel property: As a 'hotel property,' we could revolutionize the approach to fake reviews by introducing an immersive virtual reality experience where potential guests can explore a digital twin of the hotel, interact with staff avatars, and engage in live guest Q&A sessions, creating a transparent and firsthand perspective that renders traditional reviews obsolete.

TripAdvisor ranking suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Три основателя стартапа' aims to enhance the ranking algorithm and prioritize user-generated content, it is essential to incorporate safeguards against fake reviews and ensure the integrity of the review ecosystem. Therefore, I propose modifying the existing proposal to include a robust verification and reporting mechanism for user reviews to complement the new ranking algorithm.

TripAdvisor ranking declined the resolution proposed by Три основателя стартапа with reasoning: The proposed scenario by 'Три основателя стартапа' revolves around creating a platform for ranking restaurants and hotels based on user reviews, which might lead to an increased number of five-star reviews. However, this proposal does not align with the existing resolution of implementing an AI-powered review authenticity scoring system that focuses on maintaining the integrity of reviews. The new proposal could compromise the credibility of the review ecosystem by incentivizing reviews, potentially leading to more fake or biased reviews. Therefore, it does not benefit the core desire of TripAdvisor ranking to uphold the authenticity and reliability of reviews.
