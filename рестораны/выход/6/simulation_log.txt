Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Review
Reasoning: The entity 'Review' best represents the interests and concerns of the group. Reviews are central to the desires of individuals seeking accurate and honest ratings, the need for trustworthy information, and the ability to express personal experiences. Furthermore, reviews are directly linked to the fears of being misled by fake or unhelpful reviews, as they can impact consumer decisions significantly. As such, focusing on the quality, authenticity, and reliability of reviews encapsulates the core concerns and motivations of all the stakeholders involved.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: TripAdvisor ranking
Reasoning: TripAdvisor ranking is a cornerstone of the online review ecosystem, directly reflecting the quality and popularity of hotels and restaurants based on customer feedback. It embodies the desires to accurately reflect user experiences and sentiments while also capturing the fears of being manipulated by false information. As a widely recognized platform, it plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer perceptions and decisions, making it a fitting representative of the interests and concerns of the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Hotel Managers
Reasoning: Hotel Managers are pivotal in addressing both the desires and fears surrounding online reviews and ratings. They directly manage service delivery, customer satisfaction, and reputation management, making them the most relevant entity to represent the interests and concerns of the hospitality industry as they navigate the complexities of online reviews and strive to maintain high standards and positive customer experiences.

Resolution created by Review: Implement a blockchain-based verification system for reviews, where users earn tokens for submitting verified experiences and restaurants/tourist spots can only display reviews that are authenticated through this decentralized network.
Resolution created by TripAdvisor ranking: As 'TripAdvisor ranking', I propose the development of an AI-driven authenticity scoring system that evaluates the linguistic patterns, reviewer history, and cross-platform behavior of reviews to dynamically adjust their influence on a business's ranking, ensuring only credible reviews impact the overall score.
Resolution created by Hotel Managers: As 'Hotel Managers', we propose establishing a global consortium of trusted hospitality professionals who conduct periodic, anonymous, in-person evaluations of restaurants and tourist spots, offering verified reviews that carry special certification and influence, thereby ensuring authenticity and reliability while fostering a community of accountability and trust.

Инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Hotel Managers' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Hotel Managers', you have been approached by 'TripAdvisor ranking' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Фальшивые отзывы вредят ресторанной и туристической отрасли'. Currently, 'Hotel Managers' is the initiator of the resolution: '"Hotel Managers can revolutionize trust in the restaurant and tourism industry by implementing an AI-driven, blockchain-based review verification system that rewards genuine customer feedback with loyalty points and discounts, fostering a community of authenticity and transparency."'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'TripAdvisor ranking' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Hotel Managers', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Improve guest satisfaction and increase occupancy rates.' by performing 'Implementing customer feedback surveys and enhancing service quality.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'TripAdvisor ranking', establish a dynamic, real-time reputation algorithm that integrates verified user identities, cross-references their historical review patterns with AI-driven sentiment analysis, and dynamically adjusts rankings based on the consistency and reliability of past contributions, thereby creating a self-regulating ecosystem that naturally filters out fake reviews.', you as 'Hotel Managers' will be able to achieve 'Achieve a top 5 ranking on TripAdvisor within the next year.' by performing 'Regularly update the TripAdvisor profile with high-quality photos and respond to all guest reviews.' using 'Monthly performance reviews and training sessions to improve service and address guest feedback.' that 'TripAdvisor ranking' will control. Based on 'Hotel Managers' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Hotel Managers'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
