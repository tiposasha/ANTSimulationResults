Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Review
Reasoning: The entity 'Review' best represents the interests and concerns of this group because it encapsulates the essence of what consumers, reviewers, and travelers seek when engaging with platforms. Reviews serve as a medium for sharing experiences, influencing decisions, and providing feedback, which aligns closely with the desires for accurate information and the fears of being misled by fake or untrustworthy reviews. By focusing on 'Review', we acknowledge the central role that reviews play in shaping consumer experiences and perceptions in the context of hospitality and e-commerce.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: TripAdvisor ranking
Reasoning: TripAdvisor ranking serves as a prominent and recognizable metric in the hospitality and tourism industry, reflecting the quality of accommodations based on customer reviews. It encapsulates the interests of accurately representing user experiences, combating fake reviews, and maintaining a reliable reputation system, while also addressing concerns around manipulation and misrepresentation of ratings. As a widely used platform, it influences consumer decisions and reflects the broader dynamics of review systems.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Restaurants
Reasoning: The entity 'Restaurants' best represents the interests and concerns of the group because it encapsulates a broad range of issues related to customer reviews and ratings that are vital for attracting and retaining customers. Restaurants face significant pressure to manage their online reputation, as positive reviews directly influence customer decisions and revenue. Additionally, they are particularly vulnerable to negative reviews and fake ratings, which can severely impact their business, making them a key focus within the hospitality and tourism industry.

Resolution created by Review: "Review" could resolve the issue of fake reviews by implementing a blockchain-based verification system that rewards users with tokens for authentic reviews, ensuring transparency and accountability in the restaurant and tourism industries.
Resolution created by TripAdvisor ranking: "TripAdvisor ranking could revolutionize the fight against fake reviews by developing an AI-driven authenticity verification system that cross-references user behavior patterns and external data sources, enhancing the reliability of reviews while providing a dynamic, real-time ranking adjustment for restaurants and hotels."
Resolution created by Restaurants: "Restaurants" could introduce a 'Verified Experience Program' where diners are invited to participate in a post-visit digital feedback session directly at the establishment, utilizing biometric verification to authenticate their presence, thereby ensuring genuine reviews and fostering trust in the restaurant and tourism industries.

'Три основателя стартапа' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Инвесторы', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Evaluate potential investment opportunities in innovative startups.' by performing 'Conducting due diligence on selected startup proposals.'.

Инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed platform for ranking restaurants and hotels based on user reviews addresses a significant issue in the industry, there are concerns regarding the reliability of the review data and the potential for fraudulent reviews that could impact the platform's credibility. To align with the desires for long-term income and mitigate fears of financial loss, the proposal should include mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of reviews and a clear strategy for maintaining user trust. Additionally, incorporating a phased funding approach tied to performance metrics could further ensure that investments are safeguarded against potential pitfalls.

Инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Три основателя стартапа with reasoning: The proposal to create a platform for ranking restaurants and hotels based on user reviews does not directly align with the desire for long-term income from investments in promising startups. While it may offer potential for growth, the fear of losing invested funds due to the platform's failure or unreliable information remains a significant concern. The lack of clear evidence on how the platform will mitigate these risks makes it an unattractive investment at this time.

Инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'TripAdvisor ranking' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'TripAdvisor ranking', you have been approached by 'Review' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Фальшивые отзывы вредят ресторанной и туристической отрасли'. Currently, 'TripAdvisor ranking' is the initiator of the resolution: '"TripAdvisor ranking could revolutionize the fight against fake reviews by implementing a blockchain-based verification system that authenticates user identities and links verified purchase histories to reviews, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in the restaurant and tourism industries."'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Review' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'TripAdvisor ranking', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maintain a high ranking on TripAdvisor for increased visibility and bookings.' by performing 'Responding to reviews and updating listings regularly.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Establish an AI-driven review aggregator that cross-references and analyzes diverse data sources such as social media, transaction records, and geo-location data to dynamically assess the authenticity of reviews, providing a real-time trust score for each review that evolves with user interactions and feedback.', you as 'TripAdvisor ranking' will be able to achieve 'Achieve a top 10 ranking in the local category within the next quarter.' by performing 'Implement a customer feedback strategy and enhance the quality of service based on reviews.' using 'Establish a monthly review meeting to assess progress, share feedback received, and strategize improvements.' that 'Review' will control. Based on 'TripAdvisor ranking' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'TripAdvisor ranking'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
