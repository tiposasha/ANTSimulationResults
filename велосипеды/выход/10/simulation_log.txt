Social Vulnerability to Hazards declined the resolution proposed by Иностранные покупатели with reasoning: The proposal from 'Иностранные покупатели' focuses on establishing an international consortium and creating universal packaging standards, which may overlook the specific needs and contexts of socially vulnerable populations. While it aims to enhance cargo resilience on a global scale, it does not prioritize the empowerment of local artisans or the preservation of traditional skills, which are crucial for community development. Additionally, the control exerted by 'Иностранные покупатели' over the training programs and resource distribution may limit the agency and autonomy of vulnerable populations in addressing their own needs. Therefore, this proposal does not adequately align with the interests and empowerment objectives of 'Social Vulnerability to Hazards'.
