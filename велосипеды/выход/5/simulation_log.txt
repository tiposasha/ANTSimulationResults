vulnerable populations suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposal to leverage social vulnerability mapping and empower local communities as freight care specialists has merit, but it may not fully align with the original intent of empowering vulnerable populations through cargo guardianship. While it does address community resilience and economic stability, it lacks a direct focus on the specialized training and advocacy role that would foster ownership and sustainable employment within vulnerable populations. Therefore, I propose modifying the resolution to ensure that both the empowerment of vulnerable populations and the enhancement of community resilience are addressed in a complementary manner.
