Logistics Management Platform System suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed use of augmented reality (AR) packaging to influence handler behavior is innovative and could enhance user experience, it does not directly address the core issue of minimizing cargo breakage during transportation. Instead, I propose to integrate AR packaging with the 'Smart Cargo Route Optimization' system to create a comprehensive solution. This would involve not only visually communicating fragility but also utilizing real-time data to ensure that fragile items are routed through the safest and most reliable paths, enhancing the overall efficiency and safety of the logistics process.
