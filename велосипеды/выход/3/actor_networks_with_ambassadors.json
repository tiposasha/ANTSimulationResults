Unlike the other entities, they embody the consumer perspective and have a vested interest in the dynamics of trade, pricing, and product availability. Other entities like производитель велосипедов (bicycle manufacturer) focus on production rather than consumption, while the others pertain more to logistics, design, or social issues without a direct connection to consumer behavior."
