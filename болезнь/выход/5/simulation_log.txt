Resolution by Clinical Studies has collapsed.
We ask 'Blood-brain barrier (BBB)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Blood-brain barrier (BBB)', you have been approached by 'APOE ɛ4' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Понимание и лечение болезни Альцгеймера'. Currently, 'Blood-brain barrier (BBB)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Initiate a paradigm-shifting resolution by engineering a dynamic, bio-mimetic blood-brain barrier platform that enables real-time modulation and monitoring of molecular transport and neurovascular interactions, thereby uncovering novel pathways for targeted delivery of therapeutics and early biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, fundamentally transforming disease management and prevention strategies.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'APOE ɛ4' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Blood-brain barrier (BBB)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier to protect neural tissue from harmful substances.' by performing 'Regulating the transport of molecules across the blood-brain barrier and controlling the permeability.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: APOE ɛ4, Resolution: Pioneer a disruptive approach by harnessing the genetic and metabolic interplay of APOE ɛ4 with lipid metabolism to develop precision lifestyle and pharmacological interventions that not only mitigate Alzheimer's disease risk but also enhance cognitive resilience, thereby establishing a paradigm shift from treatment to proactive neuroprotection.', you as 'Blood-brain barrier (BBB)' will be able to achieve 'Enhance the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases.' by performing 'Implement targeted modifications to the tight junctions of endothelial cells to increase their permeability.' using 'Utilize pharmacological agents or genetic modifications to selectively disrupt tight junction proteins while ensuring minimal impact on overall barrier integrity.' that 'APOE ɛ4' will control.

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) declined the resolution proposed by APOE ɛ4 with reasoning: While the proposal from APOE ɛ4 aims to shift from treatment to proactive neuroprotection, it poses a risk of compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). My primary interest lies in maintaining the BBB's protective function against harmful substances. Enhancing permeability for therapeutic delivery may lead to unintended consequences, such as increased vulnerability to neurotoxins or pathogens. Therefore, I cannot support a resolution that prioritizes increased permeability at the potential cost of my core function.

Исследователи в области нейрологии suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution offers an innovative approach to Alzheimer’s treatment and aligns with the desire to establish new treatment standards, it does not directly address the current focus on the amyloid hypothesis, which is critical for the credibility and recognition of 'Исследователи в области нейрологии'. To mitigate fears related to the validity of the amyloid hypothesis and the potential loss of funding, the proposal should incorporate a component that investigates the amyloid pathway alongside the neuroinflammation strategy. This would ensure a balanced approach that validates existing research while exploring new avenues for treatment.

Исследователи в области нейрологии suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution offers an innovative approach to Alzheimer's prevention and enhancement of brain resilience, it does not directly align with my current desire to confirm the amyloid hypothesis and obtain recognition in the scientific community. Additionally, the fear of losing years of research and funding if the amyloid hypothesis is shown to be incorrect remains a significant concern. To better align the proposal with my interests and mitigate my fears, I suggest incorporating elements that allow for exploration of the amyloid hypothesis alongside the proposed quantum dot technology, ensuring that both avenues of research are pursued in tandem.

Исследователи в области нейрологии declined the resolution proposed by Коллеги-ученые with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to develop a bio-integrated neural interface offers a novel approach to Alzheimer's prevention and the potential for a unified treatment strategy, it diverges from my current desire to confirm the amyloid hypothesis. This divergence poses a risk of undermining my research focus and credibility within the scientific community, especially if the new direction does not yield results or if it is seen as a departure from established research. Additionally, the control of the new working group by 'Коллеги-ученые' raises concerns about the integrity and direction of our collaborative efforts, potentially jeopardizing my funding and reputation should the outcomes be unfavorable.
