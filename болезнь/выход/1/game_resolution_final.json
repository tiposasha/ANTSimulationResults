Использование этих органоидов позволит создать динамические, пациент-ориентированные нейронные экосистемы, что не только поможет в подтверждении амилоидной гипотезы, но и откроет новые горизонты для разработки персонализированных терапевтических стратегий. \n\nВключение механизмов нейроадаптации и индивидуальных особенностей пациентов в исследование позволит глубже понять патогенез болезни Альцгеймера и создать более эффективные методы лечения. Таким образом, данное предложение стремится не только к подтверждению существующих гипотез, но и к революционному пересмотру подходов к пониманию и лечению этой сложной нейродегенеративной болезни.",
