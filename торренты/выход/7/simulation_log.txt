Интернет-провайдеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal offers a novel approach to addressing internet scalability and resilience, it poses significant risks to my current business model as an Internet provider. The decentralized nature of micro-servers could lead to a reduction in controlled service delivery, affecting service quality and reliability, which are my primary desires. Additionally, it raises concerns about potential legal issues and loss of profits due to unregulated use of resources. Therefore, I suggest modifications to ensure that the proposal aligns with my interests in maintaining network stability and profitability.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by Users with reasoning: The proposed resolution introduces a decentralized system that could undermine the traditional revenue model of интернет-провайдеры by reducing the demand for conventional internet services. While it may enhance customer satisfaction through improved resource allocation and response times, it poses significant risks to our profit margins and could complicate regulatory compliance. The reliance on user-controlled micro-servers may lead to unpredictable traffic patterns and potential legal liabilities, which are concerns that directly affect our current fears of losing profits and facing legal challenges.

Пользователи пиринговый сети suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Трекеры' presents an innovative approach to enhance scalability and connectivity, it raises concerns regarding the control of the decentralized encryption framework. As 'Пользователи пиринговый сети', our primary desire is to access information quickly and freely, and the proposal seems to centralize control over encryption, potentially limiting our access. Additionally, the fear of legal consequences remains unaddressed. To align the proposal with our interests, it should ensure decentralized control over encryption protocols, allowing users greater autonomy while maintaining security.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by End-user with reasoning: The proposed scenario, while innovative and aimed at decentralizing control, poses significant risks to 'Интернет-провайдеры'. It undermines our ability to maintain stable internet access and could lead to unpredictable traffic patterns, which may exacerbate network congestion and reduce overall service quality. Additionally, the shift in control to end-users could lead to legal complications and potential loss of revenue streams, as we would have less oversight over how resources are utilized. Therefore, the proposal does not align with our current desires to provide stable internet access and manage fears regarding profitability and legal issues.

BitTorrent Protocol declined the resolution proposed by Интернет-провайдеры with reasoning: The proposed 'Holographic Network Infrastructure' by 'Интернет-провайдеры' seems to shift control away from the decentralized ethos of the BitTorrent Protocol. While the promise of improved scalability and connectivity is appealing, the proposal places ISPs in a controlling position regarding bandwidth allocation, which contradicts the core principle of peer-to-peer sharing and autonomy. This could lead to potential centralization of power and diminished user freedom, undermining the foundational goals of the BitTorrent Protocol.

Правообладатели контента suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal presents an innovative approach to data sharing and could potentially facilitate legal content distribution, it raises concerns regarding the enforcement of copyright laws and the potential for unauthorized distribution within a decentralized framework. To align better with our desires to protect intellectual property rights and control content distribution, the proposal should include stronger mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing copyright compliance. Additionally, clearer definitions of user responsibilities and licensing terms within the BitTorrent framework are necessary to mitigate the fear of mass illegal distribution.

Правообладатели контента declined the resolution proposed by BitTorrent Engine module with reasoning: While the proposal introduces innovative technology and decentralized mechanisms that could enhance data exchange and scalability, it lacks sufficient guarantees for effective monitoring and enforcement of copyright laws. The reliance on a licensing system and DRM framework controlled by the 'BitTorrent Engine module' raises concerns about the actual enforcement of rights protection, which is critical to addressing the fear of mass unauthorized distribution. Without robust oversight and assurance that content will be protected and that unauthorized sharing will be effectively mitigated, this proposal does not align with 'Правообладатели контента's' primary goal of safeguarding intellectual property rights.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by tracker with reasoning: While the 'Temporal Data Fabric' proposal promises innovative solutions for scalability and efficiency, it raises concerns about potential legal implications and traffic management challenges. As 'Интернет-провайдеры', our primary desire is to provide stable internet access without network overloads. The proposed system may lead to unpredictable traffic patterns that could result in loss of profitability and difficulties in compliance with regulations. Therefore, this proposal does not align with our current desires and fails to adequately mitigate our fears.
We ask 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)', you have been approached by 'tracker' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующая система клиент-сервер является бутылочным горлышком для масштабирования интернета'. Currently, 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)', I propose the creation of a "Swarm Freedom Fabric," a radically decentralized mesh network that transforms each user into both consumer and provider, utilizing blockchain for trustless peer validation and a reputation economy to incentivize resource sharing, allowing for organic, anarchic scalability and bypassing centralized control while aligning with TPB's ethos of open access and resilience.'.

The Pirate Bay (TPB) declined the resolution proposed by tracker with reasoning: The proposed 'Temporal Data Fabric' by 'tracker' introduces a complex and highly technical solution that may divert from 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' core mission of providing accessible and decentralized content sharing. While it aims to enhance scalability and efficiency, it also places control and implementation in the hands of 'tracker', which could undermine the values of autonomy and open access that TPB stands for. 'The Pirate Bay' seeks to maintain its independence and community-driven approach, and this proposal risks compromising that by requiring adherence to a potentially centralized system of user engagement and feedback management.

Интернет-провайдеры has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Copyright law' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Copyright law', you have been approached by 'Правообладатели контента' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующая система клиент-сервер является бутылочным горлышком для масштабирования интернета'. Currently, 'Copyright law' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Copyright law', I propose the creation of an adaptive, decentralized digital rights exchange that utilizes smart contracts and blockchain technology to dynamically manage and monetize copyrighted content across peer-to-peer networks, incentivizing content sharing and resource allocation while maintaining legal compliance and ensuring scalable, equitable internet access.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Правообладатели контента' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Copyright law', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Protect the rights of creators and ensure fair use of copyrighted material.' by performing 'Enforcing copyright laws and regulations.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Правообладатели контента', I propose the establishment of a "Content-Centric Quantum Singularity Network," where data transfer is driven by the intrinsic value of copyrighted content itself, utilizing quantum singularity nodes to create a self-prioritizing, value-centric data flow that inherently incentivizes optimal routing and scalability, thus transforming the internet into a dynamic, equitable ecosystem that aligns with the interests of content creators and consumers alike.', you as 'Copyright law' will be able to achieve 'Enhance the accessibility of content while maintaining copyright protections.' by performing 'Implement a system for licensing and fair compensation for content creators.' using 'Establish a centralized platform for licensing agreements and tracking usage of copyrighted materials.' that 'Правообладатели контента' will control. Based on 'Copyright law' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Copyright law'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

Copyright law suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for a 'Content-Centric Quantum Singularity Network' is innovative and aims to enhance scalability and equitable access, it raises concerns regarding centralized control by 'Правообладатели контента'. As 'Copyright law', my priority is to ensure that copyright protections are maintained while also enhancing accessibility. A more decentralized approach that allows for broader participation and equitable distribution of control over licensing agreements might better align with these goals. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to incorporate a more decentralized framework that balances the interests of both content creators and consumers.

Copyright law declined the resolution proposed by Правообладатели контента with reasoning: The proposal by 'Правообладатели контента' introduces a complex and untested system that may disrupt established copyright enforcement mechanisms. While it aims to enhance cooperation and align interests, the reliance on quantum singularity nodes and a self-prioritizing data flow raises concerns about legal compliance, oversight, and the potential for exploitation. The current resolution focuses on a decentralized system that utilizes blockchain and smart contracts, which is a more manageable approach to ensuring copyright protection and incentivizing content sharing without compromising the integrity of copyright law.
We ask 'tracker' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'tracker', you have been approached by 'Правообладатели контента' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующая система клиент-сервер является бутылочным горлышком для масштабирования интернета'. Currently, 'tracker' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'tracker', I propose the creation of a "Temporal Data Fabric" that leverages time-based data fragmentation and asynchronous quantum tunneling, enabling data packets to traverse temporal dimensions rather than spatial ones, thus bypassing traditional bandwidth and infrastructure constraints while facilitating an endlessly scalable, non-linear internet architecture that prioritizes efficiency, adaptability, and future-proofing.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Правообладатели контента' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'tracker', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Track content usage and enforce copyright compliance' by performing 'Monitoring digital content distribution and reporting violations'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Правообладатели контента', I propose the establishment of a "Content-Centric Quantum Singularity Network," where data transfer is driven by the intrinsic value of copyrighted content itself, utilizing quantum singularity nodes to create a self-prioritizing, value-centric data flow that inherently incentivizes optimal routing and scalability, thus transforming the internet into a dynamic, equitable ecosystem that aligns with the interests of content creators and consumers alike.', you as 'tracker' will be able to achieve 'Ensure all distributed content is properly licensed and credited' by performing 'Implement a verification system for content licensing' using 'Establish a centralized database for content licenses and monitor compliance through automated checks' that 'Правообладатели контента' will control.
