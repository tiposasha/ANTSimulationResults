Интернет-провайдеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to implement a decentralized, incentive-driven bandwidth sharing network using the BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism appears to address the issue of scalability and fair sharing of bandwidth, it raises concerns about potential abuse and excessive traffic that could impact our ability to provide stable internet access. Furthermore, the legal implications of a decentralized system where users share bandwidth could pose risks to our profit margins. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to include strict bandwidth usage policies and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that our core desire for stable internet access is maintained while still encouraging fair sharing.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance bandwidth sharing and scalability, it raises concerns about the potential loss of control over bandwidth management, which could lead to network congestion and degraded service quality. Additionally, the implementation of a decentralized model may complicate the enforcement of policies and regulations, exposing Internet providers to legal risks and potential profit loss due to uncontrolled traffic usage.

The Pirate Bay (TPB) declined the resolution proposed by tracker with reasoning: While the proposal by 'tracker' presents an innovative approach to data transfer through quantum mechanics, it introduces a centralized control mechanism that goes against the principles of openness and user empowerment that 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' values. The reliance on 'tracker' to manage security and privacy could lead to potential risks of control and censorship, undermining the decentralized ethos we aim to promote. Therefore, 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' should focus on further developing the proposed decentralized content distribution network to maintain user autonomy and resilience.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by Social incentives with reasoning: The proposal from 'Social incentives' introduces a model that may increase the risk of overuse of network resources and reduce profitability due to the collective nature of shared resources. While fostering community engagement and supporting local initiatives are positive aspects, the potential for increased traffic without guaranteed revenue from these contributions raises concerns about sustainability. Additionally, control over the grant program by 'Social incentives' may lead to a misalignment of priorities between profit motives of 'Интернет-провайдеры' and the community-focused goals of the proposed platform.

The Pirate Bay (TPB) declined the resolution proposed by Social incentives with reasoning: The proposal from 'Social incentives' fundamentally alters the core mission of 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' by introducing a verification system that could potentially limit the freedom of sharing content, which conflicts with TPB's values of openness and resistance to censorship. Additionally, the control exerted by 'Social incentives' over the verification process may lead to a loss of autonomy for TPB and its community, undermining the decentralized ethos of peer-to-peer sharing. Therefore, this proposal does not align with TPB's interests.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by The Pirate Bay (TPB) with reasoning: The proposed 'Swarm Internet' undermines the traditional model of internet provision that 'Интернет-провайдеры' rely on. While it may provide a decentralized and democratized approach, it poses significant risks to my current desire to ensure stable internet access without network overloads. The reliance on user participation and resource trading may lead to unpredictable traffic patterns and potential legal challenges related to bandwidth negotiation and copyright compliance. Furthermore, the control over filtering measures to block access to The Pirate Bay would be compromised, increasing the risk of legal repercussions and potential loss of revenue due to uncontrolled piracy. Therefore, this proposal does not align with my interests and fears.

Правообладатели контента suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'PermIDs' offers an innovative approach to content licensing and management, it raises concerns about the control 'Правообладатели контента' would have over their content. The integration of a universally interconnected identity ecosystem may facilitate the licensing process, but it could also lead to potential vulnerabilities and a loss of direct oversight on content distribution. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to ensure that 'Правообладатели контента' maintain control over their licensing agreements and content distribution rights while benefiting from the efficiencies offered by the new system.

Правообладатели контента declined the resolution proposed by PermIDs with reasoning: While the proposal from 'PermIDs' aims to create a universally interconnected identity ecosystem that could improve visibility and accessibility of content, it raises concerns regarding control over content distribution. 'Правообладатели контента' prioritize protecting their copyrights and managing the spread of their works. The implementation of a system where 'PermIDs' controls integration into content management systems could undermine their ability to enforce copyright and monitor distribution effectively. Therefore, this proposal does not align with their desires for control and protection.
