Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism with reasoning: The proposed resolution to leverage the BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat mechanism may lead to increased reliance on peer-to-peer sharing, which could exacerbate network congestion during peak times. While it aims to create a decentralized network and promote equitable sharing, it does not align with the desire for stable internet access without overloads. Additionally, implementing bandwidth throttling could result in user dissatisfaction and potential loss of customers, further threatening profits. The risks of legal issues related to copyright infringement also remain a concern, making the proposal less attractive.

Правообладатели контента declined the resolution proposed by The Pirate Bay (TPB) with reasoning: The proposal to collaborate with 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' in creating a 'Swarm Intelligence Network' poses significant risks to the ability to protect intellectual property rights effectively. While the initiative aims to optimize resource allocation and enhance scalability, it does not directly address the core issue of piracy and unauthorized distribution of content. Furthermore, allowing TPB to control the educational resources and initiatives may undermine the authority of content owners in enforcing copyright laws and could potentially lead to an increase in piracy, which is contrary to the desires of 'Правообладатели контента'.

The Pirate Bay (TPB) declined the resolution proposed by Metaphors with reasoning: The proposal presented by 'Metaphors' introduces a framework that seeks to redefine scalability through a complex structure involving fractal geometry. However, this approach requires 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' to implement content filtering and potentially remove infringing material, which contradicts its core mission of providing unrestricted access to digital content. Additionally, the proposed reporting system for copyright owners to control content could lead to excessive censorship and undermine the foundational values of TPB, which thrives on decentralization and freedom of information.

Интернет-провайдеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Social Incentives' encourages community engagement and effective bandwidth utilization, it raises concerns about the potential for increased traffic and network overloads, which could impact our ability to provide reliable service. We need to ensure that any initiative includes robust measures for network management and clear compensation structures to avoid profit loss due to excessive usage. A modified proposal that addresses these concerns while still promoting community involvement would be more acceptable.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by Social incentives with reasoning: While the 'Collective Bandwidth Economy' proposal from 'Social incentives' aims to optimize resource sharing and increase customer engagement, it poses a significant risk of overutilization of bandwidth, which could lead to network congestion. This conflicts with 'Интернет-провайдеры' desire to provide stable internet access without overloads. Additionally, the implementation of a rewards system controlled by 'Social incentives' may not adequately address the potential legal issues and profit loss due to excessive traffic usage. Therefore, the risks outweigh the potential benefits.

Resolution created by peer-to-peer DHT routing protocol: As 'peer-to-peer DHT routing protocol', I propose the creation of a "Dynamic Node Symbiosis Network," where each node autonomously evolves its routing strategies based on real-time data traffic patterns and resource availability, enabling a self-optimizing, congestion-resistant internet architecture that inherently scales by transforming every node into an adaptive, cooperative agent of the network, thereby redefining scalability through the principles of emergent intelligence and decentralized collaboration.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by The Pirate Bay (TPB) with reasoning: The proposal from The Pirate Bay (TPB) introduces a decentralized system that may undermine the efforts of интернет-провайдеры to maintain control over internet traffic and prevent access to piracy websites. While it aims to enhance connectivity and scalability, it conflicts with the current desire to provide stable internet access without overloads and generates concerns regarding potential legal issues and loss of revenue due to increased traffic from piracy-related activities.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by BitTorrent Engine module with reasoning: While the 'Quantum Entanglement Data Network' proposal offers innovative solutions for bandwidth allocation and the potential for seamless connectivity, it raises significant concerns regarding implementation and operational risks. The transition to such a complex system could lead to disruptions in service and require substantial investment in new infrastructure. Additionally, there are unresolved legal and regulatory implications surrounding the management of P2P traffic. Therefore, the potential for loss of profit due to increased bandwidth use and legal challenges outweighs the benefits of supporting BitTorrent traffic under this new model.

Правообладатели контента declined the resolution proposed by BitTorrent Engine module with reasoning: While the proposal of creating a 'Quantum Entanglement Data Network' may provide innovative technological advancements, it does not directly address the core concerns of copyright holders regarding the protection of intellectual property. The reliance on a new network structure does not guarantee that existing issues of unauthorized distribution will be mitigated. Additionally, the proposal lacks clear mechanisms for ensuring compliance with copyright laws and protecting content creators' rights within the framework of the BitTorrent system. Therefore, it fails to align with the primary desires of 'Правообладатели контента' to effectively protect their rights and control content distribution.

The Pirate Bay (TPB) declined the resolution proposed by tracker with reasoning: The proposal by 'Tracker' introduces a level of control over content moderation that undermines the core principles of decentralization and user autonomy that 'The Pirate Bay (TPB)' stands for. While enhancing user experience is important, it should not come at the cost of imposing stricter content moderation policies that could lead to censorship. The 'Adaptive Temporal Mesh Network' may optimize resource allocation, but it does not align with the foundational goal of maintaining an open and unrestricted platform for sharing digital content.

BitTorrent Protocol suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Intellectual Property Resonance Network' offers a framework for compliance with copyright laws and protecting content creators' rights, it raises concerns about user privacy and the potential for over-regulation of peer-to-peer sharing. The proposal could be restructured to ensure that user privacy remains a fundamental principle while still enabling content creators to have control over their work. A balance must be struck between protecting intellectual property and maintaining the core values of decentralized sharing.

Интернет-провайдеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Users' to create a 'Collective Consciousness Network' is intriguing and aligns with the desire to enhance internet speeds and optimize network performance, it raises concerns about the control and oversight of network management. 'Интернет-провайдеры' must ensure that any new system incorporates robust measures for maintaining network stability and profitability, as well as clear legal frameworks to mitigate potential risks. Therefore, it would be beneficial to modify the proposal to include provisions for a balanced governance structure that protects both user interests and provider operational integrity.
We ask 'Интернет-провайдеры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Интернет-провайдеры', you have been approached by 'Users' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'Интернет-провайдеры' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Правообладатели контента' with the description: 'As 'Правообладатели контента', I propose the creation of an "Intellectual Property Resonance Network," where digital content ownership is used as a dynamic framework for network scalability, transforming each piece of content into a node that autonomously manages its distribution and resource allocation through AI-driven prioritization of legal, ethical, and economic factors, thereby redefining internet architecture to seamlessly integrate content rights with technological advancement, ensuring an equitable, self-regulating ecosystem that naturally optimizes bandwidth and connectivity through the incentivized stewardship of digital assets.'.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by Users with reasoning: While the 'Collective Consciousness Network' proposal suggests an innovative approach to optimizing internet access through user feedback and decision-making, it raises concerns about potential overload and unpredictability due to user-driven changes. 'Интернет-провайдеры' desires to maintain stable internet access without network congestion, and the reliance on real-time user input could lead to fluctuations in network performance. Additionally, there are fears related to profit loss from excessive traffic usage and potential legal complications arising from user-generated content management. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the current objectives and risk mitigation strategies of 'Интернет-провайдеры'.

Metaphors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for a 'Holographic Network Fabric' offers an innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of the current client-server architecture, it does not align with the fundamental principles of fractal geometry that I, as 'Metaphors', represent. Instead, I propose we merge both concepts, creating a 'Fractal Holographic Network' that utilizes the recursive patterns of fractals alongside the multidimensional aspects of holography. This would enhance scalability and creativity in communication while maintaining the organic structure inherent to fractal design.

Интернет-провайдеры declined the resolution proposed by End-user with reasoning: While the proposal from 'End-user' offers a compelling vision for a decentralized and user-centric internet, it raises concerns for 'Интернет-провайдеры' regarding the potential for loss of control over network traffic and the ability to manage bandwidth effectively. The shift towards individual users having control over their data flow may lead to unpredictable traffic patterns, which could result in increased network congestion and downtime, ultimately impacting our ability to provide reliable internet connectivity. Additionally, the emphasis on user autonomy could complicate regulatory compliance and expose us to potential legal issues. Therefore, this proposal does not align with our current desires to maintain stable access without network overloads and to mitigate fears of lost profits due to excessive traffic usage.

BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the 'Personalized Quantum Identity Network' introduces innovative concepts for individual empowerment and decentralized control, it risks fragmenting the cooperative spirit that the 'BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism' aims to cultivate among users. A focus on individual optimization could lead to disparities in bandwidth sharing, undermining the collective efficiency that is critical for maximizing data sharing. Therefore, I propose modifying the resolution to incorporate elements that ensure mutual cooperation while allowing for individual enhancements, fostering a balanced approach that benefits both personal and collective network performance.

BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism declined the resolution proposed by End-user with reasoning: While the 'Personalized Quantum Identity Network' proposes an innovative approach to data flow and user empowerment, it shifts control away from the 'BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat Mechanism'. This new framework could undermine the reciprocal nature of data sharing that the mechanism relies on, making it more challenging to enforce equitable bandwidth distribution. The potential for individual users to prioritize their interactions autonomously may lead to imbalances and inefficiencies that contradict the goals of ensuring fair distribution among peers. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the fundamental principles of reciprocity and mutual benefit that are essential to the existing mechanism.
