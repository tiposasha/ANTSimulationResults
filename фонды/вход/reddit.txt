In this thesis, we apply sentiment analysis techniques to test whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had an impact on stock returns, trading volume, option volume, and implied volatility from January 01, 2020, to March 15, 2021. We analyze each submission and comment posted on WallStreetBets during this time interval that can be linked to discussion of a selected sample of stocks, and apply sentiment analysis techniques to identify whether each post displays positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. We then analyze stocks on an individual and aggregated basis to test the following hypotheses: whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had an impact on (i) stock returns; (ii) stock volume; and (iii) option volumes and implied volatility. First, there are large variations in the results for sentiment’s impact on return on an individual basis, and while reverse causality can be attributed to explain much of the results we observe for some individual stocks, we find indicative evidence of WallStreetBets sentiment having had a statistically significant impact on the return of other stocks. On an aggregated basis, sentiment is shown to explain returns better the day after sentiment is recorded, suggesting an ability to influence future stock returns. Second, by looking at sentiment against volume we find a statistically significant relationship on most stocks in our sample, suggesting forum sentiment drives stock activity. This relationship on an aggregated basis is stronger without lagged effects, meaning same-day sentiment drives stock volumes. Finally, we find the strongest relationship in our study when looking at option-related metrics, showing a clear effect on both call and put volume as well as implied volatility both on an individual and aggregated basis. The results from our minute-by-minute model during the January 2021 rallies suggest that forum activity was a statistically significant driving force behind volume in the affected stocks. However, on the same data we could not find a statistical relationship on return, suggesting there were other influences behind the price increases than comments on the forum alone. We also develop trading strategies based on sentiment on WallStreetBets, and find that these would have yielded remarkable returns in the time interval we explore.

 1 Introduction
1.1 Background and motivation
In November 2020, the stock price of the American software company Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) rose significantly. The company had not reported any changes to its fundamentals, and there were no other news that could rationally explain such a sudden and impactful upsurge in the price of the stock. From its close on November 2, 2020, at $10.54, PLTR’s stock price had nearly tripled on December 8, 2020, when it reached its 2020 intraday high at $31.24. The Reddit subforum WallStreetBets was quickly identified as the likely actor driving the rally. The upsurge followed a period of heavy discussion of PLTR at this particular forum, and as the price surge showed no apparent sign of stopping, the WallStreetBets forum became increasingly flooded with hyping submissions and comments revolving around PLTR (Whiteman, 2021). Eventually, the PLTR rally came to an end, but WallStreetBets was soon to be world-famous for even more remarkable rallies.
Being occasional observers of the forum, entertained by the forum’s fascination for high-risk options trading strategies, the sheer magnitude of comments and submissions revolving around the stock intrigued us. We quickly identified that stock mentions had sprung over to other social media outlets and wanted to explore how the forum interacted with the market. This event was the main motivation behind looking into the topic at hand in our thesis.
2020 was a year for the history books. The COVID-19 pandemic meant that people all across the globe suddenly were forced to change their lives, habits, and behaviors to adapt to a precautionary approach to the pandemic as well as governmentally implemented restrictions (Van Bavel et al., 2021). Consequently, trading volumes in equity and derivative markets have been unprecedented (Chiah & Zhong, 2020), and the number of people entering the stock markets for the first time has been record-breaking (Rooney, 2020, AksjeNorge, 2021). Stimulus checks in the US, intended to be recycled back into

1.1 Background and motivation 2
 the economy, have for many Americans been an entry point into the stock market, where middle-class Americans traded stocks 90% more the week they received the stimulus checks than the week prior (Fitzgerald, 2020). At the same time, stock market indices have reached all-time highs (Jain & Singh, 2021), the federal funds rate has been just above 0.0% (Board of Governors of The Federal Reserve System, 2020) and yield curves have reached record-low levels (Brettell et al., 2020; Franck & Li, 2020).
Just as what happened with the stock price of PLTR in November 2020, in January/February 2021 financial markets started to witness extreme upsurges in the price of several stocks which had not experienced any noteworthy changes in their respective fundamentals. Many of these stocks had displayed flat, or even negative, stock price developments, but suddenly their prices rose many-fold. The inflicted stocks were many and from a vast range of different sectors, but what they all had in common was that they were heavily discussed at the Reddit subforum WallStreetBets. At the WallStreetBets forum, the inflicted stocks were subject to intense debate, and the community actively encouraged its members to buy the targeted stocks directly or trading in related options with the intention to create an upward price spiral. The goal of these efforts was to push the stocks’ prices significantly upwards both as a result of increased demand for the stocks and options, as well as initiating short and gamma squeezes in the particularly targeted stocks. By pursuing a strategy of targeting stocks displaying characteristics such as high short interest, i.e. a characteristic that makes stocks especially prone to short squeezes, the community sought to achieve substantial gains. It quickly became evident that when specific stocks became subject to intense discussion on the WallStreetBets forum, their prices often started to surge.
Although the phenomenon started to catch the attention of the financial media in November 2020 with the PLTR rally, in January 2021 international media’s interest in the phenomenon exploded after the gaming and consumer electronics retailer GameStop Corp. (GME) became the new target at WallStreetBets. On January 4, 2021, GME shares closed at $17.25. Roughly three weeks later, on January 28, 2021, the shares reached their peak price of $483.00, i.e. 28 times higher than what they traded at in

1.1 Background and motivation 3
 the beginning of the same month. At the same time, other stocks displayed similar tendencies, whereas AMC Entertainment (AMC), Blackberry (BB), and Nokia (NOK) serve as some of the most-known companies that suddenly became victims for these targeted attacks. To illustrate the magnitude of some of these parallel rallies, compared to their price levels before their respective price peaks AMC experienced a price surge of 480% (Keshner, 2021), BB a price surge of 112% (Aliaj & Fletcher, 2021) and NOK a price surge of 133% (Reuters Staff, 2021).
During these rallying weeks the stocks that displayed the rally-like tendencies were subject to intense discussion on WallStreetBets, and the forum itself also experienced a significant increase in the number of subscribers, posts and comments in the same time period. These coordinated efforts to try to move stock prices, facilitated and communicated at the WallStreetBets forum, have attracted massive media coverage, extensive investigation by legal and regulatory authorities and both profound criticism and enthusiasm. Some argue that actions must be taken to prevent such rallies in the future, whereas others argue that this is the beginning of a battle between retail investors and institutional investors. Nevertheless, the recent events will likely continue to be subject to extensive scrutiny from regulatory authorities, lawmakers and researchers in the months and years to come.
In this thesis we will analyze the market power of the WallStreetBets forum by examining whether sentiment on this forum has had an impact on stock returns, trading volume, option volumes and implied volatility. We will apply textual and sentiment analysis to analyze each submission and comment posted on the WallStreetBets forum from January 01, 2020, until March 15, 2021, and combine this with statistical tests and financial modelling to analyze whether the forum really can be claimed to exercise market power. Several studies have previously examined different aspects of the WallStreetBets forum, but none have yet to formally study how sentiment on the forum actually impacts the market. Our study of this contributes to the developing span of studies analyzing the forum’s market power and investment strategies based on activity on the forum.

1.2 Research question 4
 1.2 Research question
In this thesis, we combine sentiment variables constructed based on textual data from WallStreetBets with financial data from January 02, 2020, to March 15, 2021 to test;
(i) whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had an impact on stock returns
(ii) whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had an impact on stock volume
(iii) whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had an impact on option volumes and implied volatility
During this time period, a massive number of news articles claimed that WallStreetBets had driven several stocks’ prices to unprecedented levels. We test this relationship for 18 stocks individually and aggregated to analyze whether sentiment on WallStreetBets actually can explain these variations. WallStreetBets is characterized by being a forum dedicated to high-risk trading strategies utilizing options to maximize potential returns, and by testing these hypotheses we are also able to analyze whether this strategy has had an impact on option volumes and implied volatility.

As one of the first papers to formally analyze the WallStreetBets forum’s market power, this paper is relevant both for further research, policy makers, regulatory authorities and market participants. The recent rallies have led to huge gains for some investors, but also losses amounting to billions of dollars for hedge funds and other short-sellers, in addition to many retail investors who did not liquidate their positions in time. The monumental stock price movements shook up equity markets all around the world. Many have called the rallies detrimental for market efficiency, whereas others have called it market manipulation. Price manipulation is a breach of the efficient market hypothesis, and although there is still debate as to whether the latest rallies were legal price manipulations or not, the rallies carry important implications for further regulation and trading strategies. Therefore, although we do not seek to argue whether these actions

 were either legally or morally acceptable, we believe that this research will contribute to bring knowledge and comprehension into the debate that will follow these rallies in the months and years to come.
1.4 Organization of the thesis
The first chapter of this thesis gives an introduction to the background and motivation for the thesis, as well as an introduction to the thesis’ research question. The second chapter will provide a contextual overview of some of the most important features surrounding and enabling the events we seek to explore in this thesis. In chapter 3, relevant literature and research is explored. Chapter 4 presents the data and methods we have utilized in our analyses. Chapter 5 presents the results and discussion of our analyses. In chapter 6, we conclude our findings and discuss this research’s limitations as well as suggestions for further research.
Throughout the thesis, although the forum is commonly referred to by many acronyms, we will generally refer to the forum as WallStreetBets. We will also use stock tickers to refer to the stocks we discuss (see table 4.2 for an overview of the thesis’ selected stock sample and their tickers). Finally, activity will be used as a term describing overall stock mentions, positive sentiment to describe the percentage positive sentiment a stock experiences, whilst sentiment will be used as a broad term incorporating both.

 2 Context
2.1 The coronavirus’ impact on financial markets
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, at least 37 international equity markets have experienced a large spike in aggregated trading volume (Chiah & Zhong, 2020). Ordered to stay at home, many Americans have flocked to zero-commission trading platforms such as Robinhood, which experienced a three-fold increase in trading volume in March 2020 from its 2019 level (Rooney, 2020). Investors have opened new trading accounts, and on average added funds to their accounts and established more new positions in stocks (Ortmann et al., 2020). Panigirtzoglou et al. (2021) use small traders’ equity option flows as a proxy for retail investors and find that the retail impulse in the financial markets has been strong during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also find that the share of retail-driven stock market trading volumes in the US reached unprecedented heights in January 2021, in addition to finding that retail investors have preferred large tech stocks as well as stocks with low market capitalization during 2020 as well as in January and February 2021 (Panigirtzoglou et al., 2021).
Given the extremely low interest rates during the pandemic, where many central banks have operated with interest rates very close to or precisely 0%, investors have had few other alternatives than to tilt their portfolios towards stock markets to achieve notable returns. At the same time, due to cancellation and postponement of sports events, the European sports betting industry saw a massive decrease in their gambling revenues during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (Auer et al., 2020). Several studies have shown that trading in stock markets may function as a substitute for gambling (see e.g. Gao & Lin, 2015; Kumar, 2009; Li, 2012), meaning that the increased trading volumes experienced world-wide may be partially explained by more time spent at home, the substitution effect of gambling and the introduction and adaptation of several zero-commission trading platforms.
These observations may explain how such price rallies we seek to explore in this thesis

2.2 WallStreetBets 7
 could erupt in the first place. Being heavily discussed on the WallStreetBets forum, the stocks subject to these rallies have been remarkably popular among retail investors during the time period of the rallies. The COVID-19 pandemic can arguably be attributed to explain much of the heightened retail impulse in the financial markets over the last year. We would also argue that the pandemic has contributed to increased activity on WallStreetBets, and thereby having facilitated the foundation for the massive discussion and subsequent stock rallies we explore in this thesis.
2.2 WallStreetBets
Reddit is an American social network platform founded in 2005, offering its members access to submit and interact with various content (Reddit.com, 2020). As of February 2021, Reddit.com was the 18th most visited website in the world and the seventh most visited website in the US (Alexa.com, 2021). The Reddit platform is organized along different subforums, or subreddits, whereas each subreddit is dedicated to a specific category of content. WallStreetBets, alternatively r/wallstreetbets or WSB, is a subreddit created by Jaime Rogozinski in 2012 that is dedicated to discussion and communication revolving around high-risk/reward short-term trading operations (Anthony, 2020).
Starting from January 2020, continuing throughout 2020, WallStreetBets experienced a steady increase in the number of its subscribers, posts and comments per day (Subreddit Stats, 2021). Eventually the subforum became subject to speculations as to whether coordinated trading efforts on the subforum, made possible by pooling the users’ financial power, had the potential to move stock prices (see e.g. Kawa, 2020b; Sheetz, 2020; Zweig, 2020). These speculations came specifically after a time of seeing multiple stocks, e.g. PLTR, Plug Power, Inc. (PLUG) and Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (SPCE), with seemingly no news experienced soaring stock prices after having been subject for discussion on WallStreetBets (see e.g. Kawa, 2020a; Lipschultz, 2020; Powell & Stafford, 2020; Wang & Hajric, 2020).
In January 2021, WallStreetBets experienced a surge in its popularity, measured by the

2.2 WallStreetBets 8
 number of subscribers, comments and submissions (Subreddit Stats, 2021). The surge was fueled by the immense scrutiny and attention from the media as the equity and option markets observed significant price movements in particular securities following intense discussions on WallStreetBets. WallStreetBets was as of February 2021 among the four most active subforums in terms of comments per day on the Reddit platform, and has over nine million subscribers (Subreddit Stats, 2021). Below, three charts showing the development in terms of subscribers, posts per day and comments per day on the WallStreetBets subreddit are displayed.

2.3 Robinhood 10
 2.3 Robinhood
Robinhood Markets Inc., hereby Robinhood, is an American financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California (Craft.co, 2021) that offers trading in stocks, funds, ETFs, options, golds and cryptocurrencies, as well as other products (Robinhood, n.d.c.). Robinhood offers commission-free trading to its customers, and had 13 million users as of 2020 (Rega, 2020). Their revenue streams come from their premium subscription program Robinhood Gold, stock loan income, interest on interest-bearing bank accounts, cash management services, proxy service revenue and fees (Robinhood, n.d.b). In addition, Robinhood earns rebates through payment for order flow by selling its customers’ orders to market makers who then can execute these trades (Robinhood, n.d.b.).
The company has announced a vision of democratizing finance for all, thereby offering products aimed at their retail investor-based target group (Robinhood, n.d.a). Retail investors wanting to trade in options and other derivatives would previously have a challenge of doing so, as the financial systems did not allow retail investors easy access to such "advanced" financial products. With the democratisation of finance in recent years, companies such as Robinhood have enabled easy access for retail investors to options and derivative trading. In chapter 5, we find that sentiment on WallStreetBets can be claimed to have had a statistically significant impact on call and put option volumes. We would argue that this is made possible and enabled by the democratisation of finance that has evolved over the recent years, where Robinhood and similar retail investor trading platforms have facilitated easy access for retail investors to products they previously would have troubles of trading in.
While US retail investors use many different trading platforms in addition to Robinhood, such as Etrade, TD Ameritrade and Schwab, Robinhood is often considered as the most popular stock broker among WallStreetBets users (see e.g. Alfonso III, 2021; Sarlin, 2021). Most often when WallStreetBets users post screenshots of their trade balances, gains or losses, we have observed that Robinhood is the depicted trading platform. Also,

2.4 Stock rallies 11
 using textual analysis, we find that Robinhood is the most frequently mentioned trading platform on the forum, being the 143th most frequently mentioned word of all our comments. We would therefore argue that Robinhood is clearly the most important trading platform for WallStreetBets users. To fully understand the enabling factors for the recent rallies, we argue that it is essential to understand the role of zero-commission platforms such as Robinhood. An introduction of Robinhood therefore seeks to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of enabling factors.
2.4 Stock rallies
2.4.1 Stocks subject to rallies
In the time interval we are exploring in this thesis, i.e. from January 01, 2020, to March 15, 2021, many stocks displayed rally-like tendencies, and many became subject to short and gamma squeeze mechanics. Not all the rallies that erupted in our selected time interval are likely to have erupted as a result of short or gamma squeezes, but most of the stocks that displayed rallying tendencies were heavily discussed at WallStreetBets. Some rallies were more prominent and publicly debated than others, but the mechanics were often just as distinct for those who did not receive as much public attention as e.g. GME and AMC. While the number of stocks that displayed rally-like tendencies in this time interval was high, we have limited the focus to 16 of the stocks that displayed such tendencies between January 01, 2020, and March 15, 2021. All stocks except Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) in table 4.2 experienced rallies in this time period, and thereby serve as examples of the vast range of stocks that became subject to these mechanics in the time interval we explore.
2.4.2 The GME rally
The most prominent and discussed stock rally of all the stock rallies that erupted in the time interval we are exploring in this thesis is arguably the GME rally which occurred from January to February 2021. This specific episode sparked unprecedented attention both

2.4 Stock rallies 12
 from the WallStreetBets forum, media, market participants and regulatory authorities, and GME was on everyone’s lips. Just as the other rallies that took place in this time interval, GME had been specifically targeted on the WallStreetBets forum because of its high short ratio which made the stock especially prone to a joint sentiment-fueled targeted attack by investors. Being the most debated and controversial of the rallies, this episode serves as a great illustration of the magnitude and mechanics underlying this thesis, and we will therefore now provide an introduction to this particular episode.
On January 4, 2021, i.e. on the first trading day in 2021, GME’s closing price was $17.25. One year earlier, on January 2, 2020, i.e. the first trading day in 2020, GME’s closing price was $6.31, meaning that during 2020 GME’s stock price had nearly tripled. As remarkable as this may seem, this was nothing compared to what was about to evolve over the next month. On January 20, 2021, GME closed at $39.36, and only two days later, i.e. on January 22, GME closed at $65.01. Over the next days the rally continued even further, and on January 27 GME closed at $347.51. On the next day, i.e. January 28, GME reached its peak at $483.00, before it later collapsed and closed on $193.60 the same day. This collapse came as a direct result of trading restrictions imposed by several trading venues on multiple stocks, including GME (see chapter 2.4.3 for an introduction to these trading restrictions). The following days after the trading restrictions were imposed, GME’s stock price continued to fall steadily, and on February 22, the stock closed at $46.00. The GME short squeeze had come to a swift end.
In 2020 overall, the daily average trading volume in the GME stock was 6.68 million shares. In January 2021, the daily average trading volume in the GME stock was 66.43 million shares. On January 22 alone, over 197 million GME shares were traded, a daily record of over 120 million more shares than the daily trading volume record for the stock in 2020. Figure 2.4 shows the daily trading volume in the GME stock from January 02, 2020 to February 22, 2021, and shows that the trading volume spiked during the period of the rally in January 2021.

2.4 Stock rallies

  Figure 2.4: GME volume
Having, according to their perspective, successfully launched previous attacks on stocks,
the WallStreetBets community started showing explicit interest for the GME stock in November 2020. The stock became increasingly praised on the forum throughout the end of 2020, and in January 2021 the forum’s interest for the GME stock exploded (Lyons, 2021). The forum’s interest escalated particularly after the investment research company Citron Research announced that they considered GME as overvalued and therefore had started taking short positions in the stock (Ghosh, 2021a). The forum’s interest for GME was further fueled as other short-sellers eventually became identified, amongst others the investment management firm Melvin Capital being one of the most prominent of those identified (Aliaj et al., 2021).
When the short-sellers were identified, these were commonly referred to as “enemies” by the forum. This enemification of the forum’s counterparties is believed to have helped to fuel the rally further, and many users argued that the GME rally was the beginning of a battle between retail and institutional investors. Another specific event believed to have

2.4 Stock rallies 14
 contributed to the squeeze’s momentum happened on January 26, 2021, when the CEO of Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk published a one-word tweet in the jargon of WallStreetBets saying “Gamestonk!!”(Musk, 2021b). Elon Musk is often believed to move stock prices when he expresses his opinions about certain stocks, and there are many examples of episodes where tweets by Musk are followed by significant stock price movements. For example, on January 7, 2021, following a tweet by Musk saying “Use Signal” (Musk, 2021a) where Musk referred to a chat app, the stock price of the unrelated biotech company Signal Advance Inc. rose manyfold (Gambrell, 2021; Google Finance, 2021). On January 26, 2021, Musk tweeted “I kinda love Etsy” (Musk, 2021c), following up that he had bought a hand knit wool Marvin the Martian helm for his dog on the Etsy e-commerce platform (Musk, 2021c). After publishing the tweet, the value of Etsy Inc. increased by more than $2 billion (Gambrell, 2021). When Musk tweeted “On Clubhouse tonight at 10pm LA time” (Musk, 2021d) the stock price of the unrelated Clubhouse Media Group rose significantly (Gambrell, 2021). Also when Musk announced that Tesla had bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin price rose significantly (Dawson & Popina, 2021). The “Gamestonk!!” tweet by Musk is therefore widely believed to have contributed to fuel the GME rally further (see e.g. Bursztynsky, 2021; Gambrell, 2021).
In January 2021, GME was the most shorted stock on Wall Street (Ponciano, 2021), and had an accumulated short interest of 144.34%. Through most of 2020 the short interest in GME had fluctuated around 100%, but starting from September 2020 the short interest rose rapidly towards 144.34%. As the WallStreetBets-fueled targeted attack on short-sellers gradually gained momentum, the GME stock price rose significantly. To cover their positions, both as a result of limiting losses and margin calls, short sellers started buying GME stock, which contributed to the stock price being pushed further upwards. Having to unwind their short positions, the short interest in GME became significantly reduced from over 144.34% on January 14 to 42.61% on January 29, before it was further reduced to 32.78% on February 12, 2021. The following graph shows both the GME stock price and the short interest in the GME stock, and effectively shows how the short interest was reduced as the stock price rose in January 2021.

2.4 Stock rallies

  Figure 2.5: GME price and short interest
In conjunction with the short squeeze, a gamma squeeze also contributed to the upsurge in GME’s stock price. On the WallStreetBets forum many users advocated buying call options in GME to initiate a gamma squeeze, with the intent of pushing the GME stock price to unprecedented levels. Consequently, as is illustrated in figure 2.6, in the midst of January 2021 call option trading volumes in the GME stock rose significantly. To hedge their exposure, market makers having written the options started buying GME shares, which increased both the trading volume in the GME stock as well as the overall price pressure (Niu, 2021). The following graph shows GME’s option volume from January 2020 to February 2021.

2.4 Stock rallies
16
  Figure 2.6: GME call and put volume
The combination of the short squeeze and the gamma squeeze made the attack on the GME stock powerful and unparalleled. The WallStreetBets community received extensive coverage in the international media, and investors all across the globe started taking positions in the GME stock to join in on the rally (see e.g. He & Wang, 2021; Hopland, 2021; Kowsmann, 2021). As the trading volume in the GME stock, as well as other stocks also subject to short squeezes in this time period, skyrocketed, several trading platforms imposed trading restrictions on many of these inflicted stocks, including GME, on January 28 (Li & Pound, 2021). The restrictions hampered investors’ ability to buy GME shares, and investors using these platforms could only choose to sell their shares in the inflicted stocks. Not being able to trade freely, the demand-driven price pressure on GME dropped immediately, and the stock price fell significantly in only a few days. Although the restrictions were gradually eased over the next few days, the overall price pressure had lost its momentum. Combined with the short ratio having dropped significantly, the GME short squeeze was considered as having come to an end. Remark,

2.4 Stock rallies 17
 that GME is still as of May 2021 the most frequently discussed stock on WallStreetBets, and in the beginning of March the stock experienced yet another price surge. This time GME had a much lower short ratio, and the temporary surge was also relatively short-lived. Still, the stock has yet to revert back to its low levels prior to the rallies and hovers around USD 170 on May 20, 2021, almost 37 times higher than the year prior.
2.4.3 Trading restrictions
On January 28, 2021, Robinhood, Schwab and several other providers of commission-free trading platforms imposed trading restrictions on certain stocks, including GME (Li & Pound, 2021). This followed the period of significant upsurges in several stocks’ prices and option volumes. Robinhood claimed that they had experienced a ten-fold increase in their clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements as a result of the large increase in trading volumes, and therefore eventually had to impose trading restrictions on certain stocks (Robinhood, 2021). On January 28, these restrictions on the Robinhood platform meant that users could not buy more GME stock or options, but could only choose to sell. Robinhood did not publish an exhaustive list over the trading-limited stocks on January 28, but published a statement saying that due to recent volatility they were “restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR and $TRVG” in addition to saying that they raised certain margin requirements (Fitzgerald, 2021).
Following the imposition of the restrictions, Interactive Brokers chairman Thomas Peterffy stated that the extreme increases in trading and option volume nearly made the entire financial system collapse, since short-sellers and market makers were near a point where they could not fulfill their obligations (Stankiewicz, 2021). This could, according to Peterffy, have created a scenario where “brokers default on the clearinghouses, so you end up with a complete mess that is practically impossible to sort out” (Stankiewicz, 2021). The next few days the trading restrictions were gradually eased, and on February 5, 2021, the trading restrictions were completely lifted on Robinhood, meaning that Robinhood-based investors again could freely engage in trades in the previously inflicted

2.4 Stock rallies 18
 stocks. Schwab has still as of May 4, 2021, special margin requirements for AMC and GME (Charles Schwab, 2021), meaning that although investors can trade relatively freely, the special margin requirements still hamper completely free trading activity on their platform. As of May 4, 2021, TD Ameritrade has still put a 100% margin requirement for long positions in the GME stock, in addition to having temporarily banned short-selling of GME (TD Ameritrade, 2021). In sum, these restrictions made the GME rally, as well as the other rallies occurring in the same time period, come to an abrupt end, and they still limit free trading. The restrictions have been controversial, and many have criticized the platforms for imposing them in the first place.
Figure 2.7: AMC, BB, GME and NOK January 2021 movements
Figure 2.7, which is gathered from Bloomberg, illustrates how certain stocks suddenly experienced significant upturns between January 25 and January 27 before they later collapsed, at least partially, as a result of the trading restrictions. The fact that several stocks’ short ratios had fallen dramatically as a result of short squeezes may also have contributed to the collapse. In the figure, we observe how the stock prices of AMC, BB, GME and NOK all rose significantly in this period, before they all fell dramatically on January 28, 2021, when the trading restrictions were imposed. After the dramatic collapse on January 28, we observe how all these stocks then rose again on January 29, before they fell further in February. The figure also shows how correlated the stocks’
 
2.4 Stock rallies 19
 prices were during this period, where upturns and downturns of different stocks parallel each other quite remarkably.
2.4.4 Aftermath of the short squeezes
The trading restrictions were met with fury and debate amongst WallStreetBets users who now were unable to trade freely (Ghosh, 2021b), and several of the affected stocks quickly plunged (Davies, 2021). The restrictions also drew wider attention. Two prominent US lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz both called Robinhood’s controversial practice into question (Jones and Carissimo, 2021). The SEC released a statement saying that they were monitoring the situation carefully and that they “will act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws and several court appeals have since been raised” (SEC, 2021). A Robinhood user filed a class-action lawsuit against Robinhood on January 28, 2021, on the basis of Robinhood’s decision to restrict trading in several stocks, calling it manipulation of the stock markets (Duffy, 2021). As of February 1, 2021, at least 25 lawsuits in 11 US states had been filed the previous week against Robinhood (Cridlin, 2021).
On February 18, 2021, a remote hearing titled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide” was held in the House Financial Services Committee, which has launched an investigation on the recent activities in stocks such as GME and the trading restrictions imposed by several trading platforms (U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, 2021; Warmbrodt, 2021). The House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters, in addition to other politicians, have announced their intentions to specifically dig into whether Wall Street hedge funds have had a role in imposing the trading restrictions. In the first hearing, both Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, Melvin Capital CEO Gabriel Plotkin, Citadel CEO Kenneth Griffin and WallStreetBets user and investor Keith Gill, more commonly known amongst WallStreetBets users as DeepFuckingValue (DFV), attended (U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, 2021). On March 17 a second congressional

2.4 Stock rallies 20
 hearing was held, where the committee focused particularly on the controversial practice of payment for order flow (Phillips, 2021) and gamification of investment and investment apps (Avis, 2021). The ultimate outcome of the hearings and regulatory proceedings are not yet clear as of May 16, 2021, but the short squeeze episodes will likely be subject to immense regulatory scrutiny in the months and years to come.
Ponczek et al. (2021) estimate that 50 of the so-called “meme stocks”, i.e. stocks that are praised on the WallStreetBets forum, gained approximately $276 billion in value from the end of 2020 to the peak of the rallies, before they lost approximately $167 billion in total when the rallies came to an abrupt end. Rao (2021) finds that the hedge funds that had taken short-positions in GME lost at least $12.5 billion as a result of the short squeeze. Prominent GME short-sellers, such as Citron Research and Melvin Capital, received extensive negative coverage in international financial media and became known for having lost tremendous amounts of money as a result of the short squeeze (see e.g. Canny, 2021; Kumar, 2021; Winck, 2021). Investors holding long positions in the GME stock during the squeeze are also expected to have incurred large losses when the GME rally swiftly ended (Brown, 2021). Overall, therefore, while some managed to get rich as a result of the short squeezes, others took on large losses and were subject to negative exposure in international financial media.

 3 Literature review
3.1 Price manipulation and retail investor affection
Joint coordinated efforts to influence a security’s price without releasing falsified information or taking actions meant to change the security’s value, e.g. as recently observed in the GameStop stock, is a form of trade-based price manipulation (Allen & Gale, 1992). In a study of stock market manipulation in the United States, Aggarwal and Wu (2003) found that illiquid stocks are more susceptible to manipulation than liquid stocks. They also found that manipulation increases stock volatility, and that over 50% of manipulated stocks in the US stock markets are “penny stocks” with low market capitalization and low average trading volume (Aggarwal & Wu, 2003). Using data from the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Imisiker and Tas (2013) found that firms with low market capitalization, as well as firms with lower free float rate are more likely to be manipulated than larger firms. Higher leverage ratio is also found to have a significant and positive effect on the probability of being manipulated (Imisiker & Tas, 2013).
Han and Kumar (2013) show that high idiosyncratic volatility, skewness and lower prices are stock-specific attributes attracting a higher proportion of retail trading in a stock. Han and Kumar (2013) also find that retail investors exhibiting a greater propensity of speculation and gambling are more likely to engage with trading in stocks with a higher proportion of retail trading. Kumar and Lee (2006) show that lower priced firms, small firms, firms with lower institutional ownership and firms with high book-to-market ratios are displaying higher retail investor concentration and trading activity. Gao and Lin
(2015) find that retail investors prefer stocks displaying high past returns, low market capitalization, low earnings per share, high market-to-book ratio and high retail trading concentration.
In a study using trading data from Taiwan, Gao and Lin (2015) find that stock market trading may function as a substitute for gambling activity. Defining “lottery-like” stocks as those with high skewness, they find that these stocks are more prone for trading as a

3.2 Retail investors’ ability to move stock prices 22
 means for fun and excitement among individual investors. Kumar (2009) and Li (2012) also argue that retail investors use stock markets as a substitute for gambling. Using data from Taiwan, Barber et al. (2009b) also find that retail investors’ gambling desire encourages investors to enter the stock market. They propose that a combination of the desire to gamble and the level of overconfidence may explain much of the active trading activity of individual investors (Barber et al., 2009b). Grinblatt and Keloharju (2009) also find that overconfidence and sensation seeking are personal traits increasing stock market trading volumes.
Guiso et al. (2008) define trust as “the subjective probability individuals attribute to the possibility of being cheated”. They find that individuals displaying high levels of trust to the financial system are more likely to buy stocks and other risky assets, and that, conditional on investing in stocks, such individuals are more prone to invest a larger share of their wealth in the stock market (Guiso et al., 2008). Chiah and Zhong (2020) find that in societies with higher levels of trust and individualism, investors tend to trade more heavily. They also find that investors living in countries with stronger protection of legal rights, sounder governance systems, higher national wealth and greater gambling opportunities are more willing to trade than others (Chiah & Zhong, 2020). Further, they find that investors use stock markets for reasons such as fear-of-missing-out, quick-to-get-rich-schemes, gambling and bargain hunting, and connect this with the significant increase in investors using the Robinhood platform as their trading platform of choice in the United States (Chiah & Zhong, 2020).
3.2 Retail investors’ ability to move stock prices
If, and to what extent, retail investors have the ability to move stock prices has for long been a hot topic among researchers. Many have speculated whether the recent stock rallies actually were driven by retail investors, where many have argued that retail investors cannot account for such large movements in stock prices as have been observed over the last couple of months, but that institutional investors have been monitoring sentiment at the WallStreetBets forum and imposed trading strategies thereof. Nevertheless, several

3.2 Retail investors’ ability to move stock prices 23
 studies show that retail investors indeed can move stock prices. Barber et al. (2009a) find that retail investors can move stock prices, and that the movement’s direction is determined by the direction of retail investors’ net trades. Kumar and Lee (2006) also find that collective trading action of retail investors can move stock prices. They also show positive systematic correlation between retail investors’ trades, i.e. that retail investor trading displays a tendency of aggregating across individual investors, and that this may move stock prices (Kumar & Lee, 2006). Another study finds that in an environment with heavy aggregated selling by retail investors, this may move stock prices even oppositely to institutional investors’ net trading direction (Burch et al., 2016). Other studies also find strong systematic correlation in the aggregate retail investors’ trading activity (Dorn et al., 2008; Jackson, 2003).
Foucault et al. (2013) argue that there are especially three explanations of why retail investors’ trades may be correlated. First, they argue that this may reflect a correlation in retail investors’ liquidity needs. Such needs may be urged by macroeconomic shocks such as economic recessions where massive layoffs force households to liquidate their asset holdings simultaneously (Foucault et al., 2013). Second, they argue that retail investors may display “herd behavior”, meaning that investors are imitating one another’s trading strategies (Foucault et al., 2013). Third, they argue that retail investors may follow momentum strategies, which in general is buying at the same time when an asset’s price is rising and equivalently selling at the same time when an asset’s price is falling (Foucault et al., 2013). De Long et al. (1990) coined investors adhering to such strategies “positive feedback traders”.
Without having access to stock market order flows we have not been able to identify which orders are coming from retail and institutional investors. By using the insights from these studies, we would nonetheless claim that retail investors can actually be claimed to have contributed to movements in stock returns during the recent rallies. Although we do not seek to distinguish between who actually have been driving the recent significant stock movements in the stocks we concentrate on in this thesis, we would argue that it is important to understand that retail investors in fact do carry the

 potential to create such price movements as the stock markets have recently witnessed.
3.3 Investor sentiment
Although there is no single commonly accepted definition of sentiment, most definitions grasp that sentiment is related to individuals’ feelings, attitudes and thoughts considering something. By sentiment we therefore adhere to Cambridge Dictionary’s definition of sentiment, which captures many of these different aspects of sentiment, whereby they define sentiment as “a thought, opinion, or idea based on a feeling about a situation, or a way of thinking about something” (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.).
Whether investor sentiment can explain stock price movements has for long been subject to extensive academic research. Shleifer and Summers (1990) argue that investor sentiment is indeed an important determinant for changes in stock prices, meaning that changes in sentiment both can rationalize stock market rallies and market setbacks, such as the rallies and following setbacks we seek to explore in this thesis. Baker and Wurgler (2006) also find that stock prices and trading volume are heavily influenced by sentiment. Furthermore, they find that stocks of firms being unprofitable, younger, having low market capitalization, being non-dividend paying, having high volatility, being growth companies or firms being in financial distress are more sensitive to investor sentiment than others (Baker and Wurgler 2006). Many of these characteristics can be observed in the stocks we are focusing on in this thesis. We would therefore argue that the intense hyping of several stocks at WallStreetBets have created positive sentiment for the stocks subject to the hyping, which is the core feature we test whether has had a statistically significant effect on stock returns. Hong and Stein (2007) also find that stock prices and trading volumes are influenced by investor sentiment, showing that stocks subject to positive sentiment are more likely to display higher trading volume and are more likely to be overvalued by investors, just as what we believe was the case for the targeted stocks on WallStreetBets.

3.4 Short-selling, short squeezes and gamma squeezes 25
 3.4 Short-selling, short squeezes and gamma squeezes
What gave rise to the short squeezes we discuss in this thesis was naturally that the stocks subject to short squeezes were shorted in the first place. Many studies have been devoted to finding why stocks are shorted, whereas Dechow et al. (2001) find that stocks are shorted as a result of low fundamental ratios. Asquith et al. (2005) find that individual stocks have a high short interest either because some investors find the stock to be overvalued, or because some investors find that convertible bonds issued by the company are undervalued, giving rise to arbitrage. Brent et al. (1990) argue that investors may hold short positions on stocks they hold long to defer taxes on capital gains. They also find that stocks with high betas and connected options and convertible securities tend to display higher short interest ratios (Brent et al., 1990). Further, Nagel (2004) finds that short interest is significantly correlated with a stock’s ratio of institutional ownership.
A stock’s short interest ratio can exceed 100%, which was observed in e.g. the GME stock prior to the burst of the GME bubble in January/February 2021, which can happen for particularly two reasons. First, it may happen if shares sold short are borrowed by another party and sold in the market again (Asquith et al., 2005). Second, it may happen as a result of naked short selling, which is to sell shares short without having borrowed or arranged to borrow shares (Boulton & Braga-Alves, 2009). In extreme cases, naked short sellers may sell shares short that do not even exist (Angel & McCabe, 2009). Naked short selling can be used as a means to manipulate a stock’s price (Christian et al., 2006) since aggressive naked short selling may lead to abnormal selling pressure on the shorted stock, pushing the stock’s price downwards (Finnerty, 2005). Abusive short sale practices are considered illegal, meaning that using short-selling strategies to manipulate the price of a stock is considered illegal (SEC, 2015).
Short squeeze is a term used to describe a situation where an initial price increase of a stock forces investors with short positions in the stock to cover their short positions, either as a result of covering losses or margin calls (Lamont, 2012, p. 21). Forced to cover their short positions, the short-sellers who initially betted on a price decrease are “squeezed”

3.4 Short-selling, short squeezes and gamma squeezes 26
 out of their short positions, meaning they have to start buying the stock which further fuels the price increase (Xu & Zheng, 2016, p. 1). The short-seller becomes increasingly vulnerable to a short squeeze the larger the total short position the seller takes (Xu & Zheng, 2016, pp. 1-2). A short squeeze often implies that the underlying stock’s price is displaying a pattern of rapid and significant increase, which then is followed by a rapid and significant decrease.
Instead of trading in stocks directly, investors can trade indirectly in stocks by trading in options with the specific stock as the underlying asset (Black, 1975). This was frequently observed during the multiple short squeezes we explore in this thesis, as investors entered these stock rallies both by buying both stock and call options. Call options are usually specified for 100 shares of the underlying stock (Corrado & Su, 1997, p. 79), meaning that by buying such call options, investors engage in bets that enable them to increase their potential gains and losses manyfold compared to investing the same dollar amount in the stock directly (Pedersen, 2021, p. 32).
Market makers selling call options to investors will buy some number of the underlying stock to hedge their positions (Armstrong, 2021). As investors joined in on the recent rallies, our data shows that call option volumes spiked, meaning that market makers had to significantly increase the number of shares bought meant for hedging their risk exposure. When the price of an option’s underlying stock increases, market makers will start buying more shares of the underlying stock, as a higher price on the underlying stock translates into higher risk for the market makers having sold the options. As the price of the underlying stocks in the recent rallies we explore in this thesis eventually increased significantly, e.g. as happened with the GME stock, market makers had to start buying even more shares, which further increased the already significantly heightened demand price pressure on the inflicted stocks. This contributed to pushing the price of the underlying stock even further upwards, meaning that they had to start buying even more shares. This type of an upward price spiral leading to market makers having sold call options have to buy more and more shares as the stock price increases, which further pushes the stock price upwards, is called a gamma squeeze (Pedersen, 2021, p.

3.4 Short-selling, short squeezes and gamma squeezes 27
 32), which we now will dig further into.
Option traders are concerned with so-called option Greeks, i.e. factors that affect the price of option contracts (Frederick, 2020), where gamma is one such factor. Option Greeks are calculated using option pricing models and are important determinants for what trading operations option traders would undertake. To understand gamma, one must first understand another option Greek, i.e. delta. Delta is commonly referred to as the hedge ratio. The delta factor shows how much the price of an option contract is expected to change if the price of the underlying stock changes by USD 1 (Frederick, 2020). If the delta of an option is 0.20, the price of the option is expected to change by USD 0.20 per USD 1 the price of the underlying stock changes. The delta factor can also be utilized for hedging purposes. If you have a short position in a call option on a stock with a delta of 0.20, you could hedge your position by buying 20 shares of the underlying stock (since option contracts normally are specified for 100 shares (Corrado & Su, 1997, p. 79)). Such a hedging strategy is called a delta hedging strategy.
Gamma is a factor measuring the rate of change in the delta factor, i.e. it explains how delta is expected to change if the price of the underlying stock changes (Summa, 2021). The properties of gamma can therefore be used by option traders to calculate expected price movements in the future. Delta is constantly changing as the price of the underlying stock changes, whereas gamma is constant (Frederick, 2020). Gamma hedging is a strategy which seeks to reduce the risk for significant stock price movements, where the trader tries to create a delta-neutral position (Scott, 2021). Such strategies are particularly in the trader’s interest to pursue in the last days before the option expires, since the time value of the option contract by then is almost completely eroded (Scott, 2021).
To illustrate how gamma squeezes such as those we explore in this thesis can erupt, let us assume that WallStreetBets users start buying significant amounts of far out-of-the-money call options in addition to the underlying stock. Even though the call options are far out-of-the-money, the market makers having sold the options need to hedge themselves by buying the underlying stock, i.e. they utilize delta and gamma hedging strategies. If

3.5 Short squeezes and gamma squeezes in a financial bubble perspective 28
 the price of the underlying stock starts increasing, so does the accumulated amount of shares bought for hedging purposes by the market makers. When using the word gamma squeeze, what now should be clear is that as market makers sell option contracts and the price of the underlying stock increases, they will start buying more and more shares to hedge their positions whereby delta and gamma are two factors explaining how many shares to buy for hedging purposes and the anticipated change in these strategies over time.
As became evident during the recent squeezes, a gamma squeeze has the potential to contribute significantly to increases in a stock’s price if the call option volume is sufficiently high. Gamma squeezes may both create short squeezes themselves or coexist with traditional short squeezes (Armstrong, 2021). Short squeezes and gamma squeezes have previously been considered as infrequently observed phenomena (Liu & Xu, 2016), but, as we explore in this thesis, short squeezes and gamma squeezes became more prevalent as several stocks became subject to these mechanics in 2020 and 2021.
3.5 Short squeezes and gamma squeezes in a financial bubble perspective
Most academic definitions of financial bubbles share several distinct characteristics, such as substantial price deviations from aggregate fundamentals (see e.g. DeMarzo et al., 2008, p. 25), significant upward price movements that eventually implodes (see e.g. Kindleberger, 1978, p. 16) and that financial bubbles are characterised as a period of unsustainable accelerating growth (see e.g. Sornette and Cauwels, 2014, p. 1). These characteristics are in our opinion similar to those observed in short squeezes and gamma squeezes. We would therefore argue that short squeezes and gamma squeezes are types of financial bubbles.
Financial bubbles come in many forms, where some serve as classic examples where the underlying asset’s value is subject to significant value appraisal, whereas in other bubbles, such as those we are exploring in this thesis, the upward price movement comes

3.5 Short squeezes and gamma squeezes in a financial bubble perspective 29
 as a result of intentional trade-based price manipulation. Economic history is full of episodes being characterized as financial bubbles, even though economists disagree to some extent as to which historical financial bubbles actually were bubbles (see e.g. Day, 2004, pp. 151-152; Garber, 1990, p. 35). The most well-known classic example of a financial bubble is arguably the Dutch tulip mania (Garber, 1990, p. 35). During the Dutch tulip mania from 1634 to 1637 tulips became the hottest craze, and the prices of tulip bulbs skyrocketed (Garber, 1990). At the peak of the mania in 1635, one single tulip bulb could sell for up to 5,500 florins, which implies a present price of as much as USD 76,000 (Hirschey, 1998). In February 1637 the prices of tulips suddenly collapsed, and it was hard to sell tulips for even a tenth of what they were worth at the peak of the mania (Garber, 1990, p. 37). Following a lengthy period of significant appraisal in the price of the tulips, the tulip mania had come to an abrupt end.
Unlike classic bubbles, the recent short squeezes and gamma squeezes we are seeking to explore in this thesis were, at least partially, intentionally created. Investors specifically targeted stocks seeking to inflate the stocks’ prices by trade-based price manipulation. This trade-based price manipulation took the shape of coordinated trading efforts by investors aimed at stocks displaying certain specific characteristics such as a high short ratio. The intent of these coordinated efforts has been to push the price of the subject securities upwards with the intent of trying to squeeze out investors with short positions in the inflicted stocks, thereby further inflating the securities’ prices.
Neither this kind of a financial bubble is a new phenomenon. One of the largest short squeezes in economic history to the time of writing is the Volkswagen (VW) short squeeze in 2008 (Allen et al., 2019). On September 25, 2005, Porsche announced their intention to acquire a stake of almost 20 percent in VW’s voting capital (Porsche, 2005). Later, on October 26, 2008, Porsche publicly announced that they had acquired control of as much as approximately 74.1 percent of VW’s voting capital through both common stock and synthetic derivative positions (Porsche, 2008a). At the same time, Lower Saxony controlled 20 percent of the voting capital (Allen et al., 2019, p. 9), meaning that only 5.9 percent of the VW voting stock was floating freely in the market. Also, at the same

3.5 Short squeezes and gamma squeezes in a financial bubble perspective 30
 time, a short position of approximately twelve percent had been built up in VW (Allen et al., 2019, p. 9).
What followed was a significant price increase in VW’s stock. On October 27, 2008 the share price opened at EUR 350, a 66 percent increase compared to the price at the previous close, and the next day it rose almost 150 percent further to EUR 520 at close (Allen et al., 2019, p. 10). This massive price increase meant that the holders of the amassed short positions of around twelve percent suddenly found themselves caught in a short squeeze and had to start covering their short positions by buying VW’s stock (Allen et al., 2019, p. 10). This fueled the price increase even further, and eventually led to that on the next day, i.e. October 28, 2008, VW suddenly had become the company with the biggest market capitalization in the world (CNBC.com, 2008).
The short squeeze became devastating for the short sellers, and the hedge funds that had shorted the VW stock lost approximately $30 billion as a result of the short squeeze (Ramey, 2021). The next four days, VW’s share price fell by around 58 percent, and one month later the price had fallen by around 70 percent from its peak during the short squeeze (Li, 2021). This came both as a result of having squeezed out the short sellers (Allen et al., 2019, pp. 9-10) and that Porsche had started unwinding their synthetic ownership positions (Porsche, 2008b). The magnitude of this episode illustrates the forces at play in short squeezes, and therefore serves as an example of how dramatic
short squeezes potentially can be.

 4 Methodology
In this chapter, the models, methods, and processes used in this thesis are illustrated. The methods used are what has been done regarding text mining, text processing and sentiment scoring, while the models explain how our results are generated.
4.1 Data collection
In this thesis, we have combined a variety of datasets to perform our analyses. The textual dataset contains all posted submissions and comments on the WallStreetBets forum from January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Since Reddit’s API does not allow direct access to this data, we have used a python script to extract this data from pushshift.io, an open-source Reddit database that collects daily data from most subreddits. We then ran the script through the Windows command prompt, scraping all submissions from WallStreetBets over our given time period. With pushshift.io being an open-source database run by Jason Baumgartner, there were limitations to how many requests per minute the database could handle, thus the process was time consuming. An unfortunate consequence of the database was that some days of WallStreetBets data was missing, but overall we are grateful to Baumgartner for singlehandedly creating the database, since without it, this thesis would not have been achievable. The missing dates are shown in table 4.1.
Table 4.1: Missing dates

                                    3/6/2021
The dataset contains 1 203 556 unique submissions and 27 612 806 unique comments.

4.1 Data collection 32
 Given the relatively large number of submissions and comments and related attributes, the downloading process of this data alone took over two months. The submissions and comments are given a vast range of attributes in this dataset, where most attributes are purely technical attributes used for database and website purposes. We have therefore chosen to include only those we deem useful for textual analysis purposes.
The attributes we have chosen to use in the submissions part of the dataset are structured as follows: id; selftext; title; created_utc. Each submission is given a unique ID, which can be used for identifying purposes, as well as linking comments to the submission at which they were posted. selftext is the textual content underlining the title if the submission is a text post rather than one containing a picture or a link. title is the title of the submission. created_utc shows the specific time the submission was posted, and is on UTC-format.
The attributes we have chosen to use in the comment part of the dataset are structured as follows: body; created_utc; parent_id. body is the actual textual comment. created_utc shows the specific time the comment was posted and is on UTC-format. parent_id is the ID of the submission to which the comment was posted. To be able to use sentiment analysis techniques on comments as well as submissions, we have added an attribute to each comment, Com_ID, which is an unique ID that enables identification of each comment, just as each submission is given a unique ID.
Daily stock prices and trading volumes from January 02, 2020, to December 30, 2020, are collected from the CRSP database. Daily stock prices and trading volumes from January 04, 2021, to March 15, 2021, are collected from Yahoo! Finance.
Intraday prices and trading volumes, implied volatility, call option volumes, put option volumes and short ratios for each stock from January 02, 2020, to March 15, 2021, have been collected from Bloomberg.
Data for the Barclays and Goldman Sachs long and short baskets are collected from Bloomberg. Data from Russell 3000 is collected from Bloomberg.

 factors SMB, HML, RMW, CMA and Mom have been collected from the French data library (French, 2021).
4.2 Data filtering
Due to the large variety of stocks discussed on WallStreetBets, decisions had to be made regarding which stocks to include in our thesis. A selection process was induced where the stocks most frequently mentioned on the forum as well as a random sample of stocks experiencing surges during our research period were chosen. There were also two control stocks introduced with AAPL and GOOG being large tech stocks, the sector with the most attention on the forum, whom were also frequently discussed. On the basis of this selection process, this thesis will focus on the 18 stocks listed in table 4.2 from January 01, 2020, and March 15, 2021.

 The text process then begins with the filtering process. In the first step all posts’ Submission Title is scanned for the company name, company ticker and other company pseudonyms. For example, for Alphabet, Inc. this would be Alphabet, Inc., Alphabet, Google and GOOG. The process was then repeated for each submission’s text, and finally each individual comment was scanned for company related keywords. Due to the fact that each title, submission text or comment could contain discussion about more than one stock, the ID of the comment or submission was stored alongside the Ticker identified in a wide format. This was done to prevent duplicate entries in our dataset.
The dataset was then filtered out by ID to contain only the comments and submissions containing our stocks of interest, merged to a single data frame consisting of all comments and the matched submissions with the associated tickers, reducing the overall size of the data to 6 740 104 rows.
The final step before sentiment analysis could be performed is known as preprocessing and data cleaning. First, all html links are removed from the dataset as they only provide noise, then stemming and lemmatization is performed to reduce words to their root form. An example of this would be to transform playing, played and plays to play. This practice reduces the amount of word alternatives, but keeps the actual words intact. Next, all common stop words in English are removed as these do not contain any information relevant for the sentiment analysis. Finally, all words are transformed to lowercase and all excess whitespace between words are removed. The main benefit of this process is to reduce the actual size of the data without reducing the information value of the content, thus reducing the computational strain when working with big data. With less noise in the textual data, the sentiment analysis will also perform better than if no preprocessing was performed.
4.3 Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is a term used to describe analytical techniques that identify and measure the sentiment of what is subject to analysis. To analyze whether sentiment on

4.3 Sentiment analysis 35
 the WallStreetBets forum has had an impact on various stock and option metrics, we have applied sentiment analysis techniques on all submissions and comments posted on WallStreetBets from January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Our goal of applying sentiment analysis is to gauge the sentiment around specific stocks on WallStreetBets, and see whether positive, neutral or negative sentiment or fluctuations in these have any impact on stock prices. The sentiment analysis process in this thesis is shown in figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Sentiment analysis process
To clarify the different distinctions between the terms submissions, submission title, submission text and comments, below follows a screenshot of a submission on WallStreetBets by the user SuperShortSqueezer (2021), which graphically indicates

 what we categorize as submission, submission title and submission text:

To illustrate how comments to submissions on WallStreetBets look like, below follows a screenshot of some of the comments to the submission in figure 4.2 above. As is evident in the screenshot, while the submission seems to display a positive sentiment for BNGO, the following comments show that individuals’ sentiment around BNGO differ.

  Figure 4.3: Comment example
When defining our sentiment variables, we wanted to create a measure of sentiment of each of the stocks subject to analysis in this thesis based on the textual content in each submission and comment posted on WallStreetBets in this time interval.
One alternative to analyze sentiment could be to use an attribute called “score” in the original dataset that we retrieved from pushshift.io. Score is based on a function on Reddit, where each post can be given an upvote or a downvote by users. Each upvote counts as +1, whereas each downvote counts as -1. Score shows the net sum of upvotes and downvotes and is therefore indicative of sentiment revolving around posts on WallStreetBets. However, due to inconsistencies based on when pushshift.io saves comments and submissions at various periods during the day, comments that could receive thousands of upvotes can potentially be stored in the database as having a score of only 1, meaning that the reported score does not reflect the true score for each post, we have chosen not to incorporate or utilize the score attribute further into our dataset or analysis.

4.3 Sentiment analysis 38
 4.3.1 Choice of sentiment method
In R there are many packages available for sentiment analysis. The sentimentanalysis package contains dictionaries like Harvard IV and Loughran-McDonald’s “Master Dictionary”. Despite this, due to the informal and sometimes rather vulgar language on the forum, both dictionaries gave significantly negative scores on all aggregated posts. The VADER sentiment package, an open-source rule-based sentiment analysis package and lexicon invented specifically for text data on social media, was also an alternative. Unfortunately, most sentences were again classified as negative and all existing sentiment analysis packages based upon dictionaries were thus decided against.
The next alternative was to investigate machine learning models, specifically supervised ML algorithms trained on the comments. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in the comments, as well as linguistic changes that occurred during the peak of WallStreetBets activity around the end of January 2021, a different approach was adopted.
In order to have as much control as possible on the output from the sentiment analysis, a WallStreetBets dictionary was created. From our original dataset containing 27 612 806 unique comments spanning from January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2021, the data was cleaned and the 15 000 most frequently used words were extracted. Scores were assigned from -1 to +1 on words that were either clearly positively or negatively charged, ignoring words that could be used in both contexts. Due to the language used on the forum, words that are usually negatively charged could be used in both a positive and negative fashion such as a WallStreetBets favourite; “ape”, a word used both as a term to signal a kinship with the forum and as an expression for a user doing an apelike trade, were subsequently not used in our dictionary.
A sample from the dictionary output is shown in table 4.3.
Emojis were encoded in Unicode and had to be transformed to an interpretable word, where for example “ðŸš€” were converted to “rocketemoji”. Emojis were frequently used

 Table 4.3: Dictionary output Word Score
short -1 long +1 loss -1 rocketemoji +1 tendi +1 bad -1 yolo +1 crash - 1 miss -1
during the rallies where “paperhands” were used as a negative term for people who sold, whilst the “rocketemoji” and “diamond hands” emojis were used to signal either a stock ready to soar or particularly for the GME-related short squeezes having diamond hands and holding the stock through price descents.
4.3.2 Sentiment scoring
From the filtered dataset, a ticker was assigned to the comment if the comment ticker was missing, but the associated submission had a ticker either in its title or submission text. This was performed since a comment, such as the second comment in figure 4.3, could talk about a stock discussed in a submission without explicitly mentioning the ticker in the comment. The filtered dataset was then converted to a long format where each comment, submission text or title would only have one ticker associated with it. The next step was to create a column with which days the stocks were talked about. Due to American stock exchanges closing at 21:00 UTC, all comments and submissions posted after 21:00 UTC in the dataset were transformed to the next day as it would not impact current day stock activity.
With the dataset ready for the sentiment analysis, each stock was extracted individually, merged with the dictionary tallying each occurrence of positive or negative words in the comments, and given a sentiment value. For example, a comment including two
 
4.3 Sentiment analysis 40
 words defined as displaying positive sentiment, i.e. “buy” and “undervalued”, e.g. saying “buy GameStop, it is undervalued” would be given a score of +2 and indicate positive sentiment for GME, whereas a comment saying “sell GME, it is overvalued” would have a score of -2 and indicate negative sentiment for GME. Neutral comments are comments that either do not indicate any emotionally charged language, or comments that are 50% positive and 50% negative to a stock, which would have a score of 0. For example, a neutral comment could say “On one side I want to buy GameStop, but on the other side I think it is overvalued” or simply “I neither want to buy or sell GameStop”.
Aiming to have a normalized measure of sentiment that did not depend on the frequency of mentions, a decision was made to look at sentiment direction instead of numerical sentiment scores. Thus, sentiment score for the comment, title and submission text on day t is given by:
P P ositive Sentimentt
Percentage Positive Sentimentt = PNegative Sentiment +PPositive Sentiment ∗ 100 (4.1)
tt
where positive sentiment is a comment, submission title or submission text with a sentiment score above 0, and negative sentiment is a comment, submission title or submission text having a sentiment score below 0. As neutral comments with a score of 0 does not indicate positive or negative sentiment, they were not included in the calculations. Subsequently, percentage positive sentiment for comments a day with 80 positive comments and 20 negative comments would be 80% for the day. Daily occurrences with neither positive or negative comments were given a neutral sentiment score of 50% as these were rare, but a score of 0 or NA would either alter our findings or remove entire rows of data from the regressions.
Sentiment was also calculated with a similar process on a minute-by-minute basis on selected stocks, where instead of aggregating sentiment per day, it was calculated per minute.
 
4.3 Sentiment analysis 41
 4.3.3 Final dataset
The final step in preparation for the regressions is to create datasets for individual stocks. Based on the stock prices gathered from CRSP and Yahoo! Finance we have calculated daily returns for each stock. We have chosen to use logarithmic returns because logarithmic returns better capture aspects such as log-normality, time-additivity and numerical stability than arithmetic returns. We have then subtracted the daily logarithmic returns we have calculated by the risk free rate. Daily logarithmic returns are calculated as follows, where p is the price of the stock at day t:

returns, we have added Amihud’s illiquidity factor for each stock daily from January 02, 2020, to March 15, 2021, in our dataset. This is calculated as follows, where p is the

 price of the stock at day t and vol is the trading volume for the stock at day t:

 Further, our dataset contains implied volatility, call and put volume, daily volume and price data as well as the Fama-French factors SMB, HML, RMW, CMA and Mom. This daily data was then merged with our constructed sentiment variables; Comments per day, Positive sentiment comments, Title per day, Positive sentiment title, Title text per day and Positive sentiment title text.
We decided against utilizing WallStreetBets data gathered from the weekend, as forum activity significantly dropped off during this period, and as we wanted to assess how activity translated to stock movements, looking only at weekday interactions was opted for instead of aggregating weekend activity towards the next week.
Finally, to get a better assessment of whether stock movements were driving forum activity or if forum activity was driving the stock movements, lag and lead variables were

In order to assess the impact of WallStreetBets on various stock metrics, we utilize regressions in order to capture the statistical relationship between the variables. We use the Fama-French Mkt.RF factor as the control variable for excess return on the market portfolio as well as the benchmark index in the thesis. The Nasdaq Composite index is often used as a control variable and/or benchmark index, but this index is very technology-heavy. Given the relative sector-spread in the stocks in the sample subject for analysis in this thesis, we have chosen to use the Fama-French benchmark factor Mkt.RF as the benchmark index. We have therefore used this benchmark factor as a control variable in the regression tables in chapter 5, as well as the benchmark index where this is indicated in chapter 5.
To ensure heteroscedastic-consistent estimations in the regressions, we use vcovHC as our standard error estimator to ensure heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in all our regressions.
We have chosen to perform analyses on both the time interval overall as well as dividing the time period into two subsections, i.e. 2020 and 2021. The foremost reason for this division is that we want to analyze whether the January 2021 rallies changed the mechanics driving the different rallies. Given the magnitude of the January 2021 rallies, by dividing the period into two subsections this makes us able to analyze potential differences in the rallies and thereby analyze whether the rallies in 2021 were structurally different to the rallies in 2020. Another reason is that several of the stocks that caught WallStreetBets’ attention in 2020 did not catch WallStreetBets’ attention during the multiple rallies in 2021. By separating the two periods, we manage to perform more in-depth analyses of the different sets of stocks in the two sub-periods. Further, the magnitude and implications of the two sub-periods differ greatly. Even though the stocks that caught WallStreetBets’ attention during the first sub-period, i.e. 2020, were subject to heavy discussion, the total level of activity was greatly surpassed by the total level of activity in the second period, i.e. 2021. To better be able to analyze the first rally

4.5 Regression models 45
 episodes that WallStreetBets was accused of having caused, a separation of the two periods facilitates a more comprehensive analysis of the first of these episodes.
Another reason for the split is that the activity in the two different sub-periods took different forms. While the activity on WallStreetBets in the first sub-period centered around discussions where a select few stocks were the flavor of the month, the second period was characterized by discussion revolving almost solely around those subject to a potential short squeeze, and with a much more aggressive approach. The jargon on the forum thereby changed from the first period to the second, and a division of the two periods then facilitates a better ground for comparison and analysis of the change in magnitude and forces that evolved from the first period to the second.
The regressions created for 2020 and 2021 are set up the exact same way as the stock regressions outlined below, but with only data from 2020 and 2021 respectively. The data for 2021 alone naturally contains fewer observations than the data for 2020, since we analyze data for 2020 from January 02 to December 31, while the data for 2021 contains a larger portion of missing data, and only ranges from January 04 to March 15, i.e. 44 observations. This generally lower number of observations in 2021 can carry potential distorting effects into the regressions, so we advise to bear in mind the differing number of observations when comparing the different analyses for 2020 and 2021.
4.5.1 Individual regressions
For the stock-individual regressions, we estimate the effect of the sentiment variables, the return on the market portfolio and the Fama-French factors on stock returns, trading volume, implied volatility, call option volume, put option volume and the Amihud illiquidity factor on individual stocks. The models we seek to estimate can be formulated as follows:

Further, we also estimate the effect of the sentiment variables, the return on the market portfolio and the Fama-French factors on lagged return variables. It is important to note that the control variables are not lagged in the regressions in order to better capture the effect of the lagged sentiment variables. These models can be formulated as follows:

4.5.2 Aggregated regressions
For the regressions with categorical variables, AAPL has arbitrarily been chosen as the baseline regressor, utilized as the constant in the regressions. The remaining tickers are to be interpreted as dummy variables where the coefficient is multiplied with 1 if the ticker of interest is investigated, all other dummies being 0. Below, the model we estimate for return is formalized. The rest of the models in the regressions with categorical variables, such as lagged return, lagged volume and the year specific regressions, are identical to the regressions outlined above, only with all the tickers included for an aggregated result over the entire dataset.

For the minute-by-minute regressions we have only included comments, not submissions, to assess what impact sentiment had on stock fluctuations in real-time. Submissions are generally posted less frequently than comments, meaning that by excluding submissions we take into account the general variation in the relative posting frequency of the two. One submission can only be written by one author, which implies that the actual discussion of the stocks occurs in the comment sections on the submissions or, alternatively, in so-called

4.5 Regression models 49
 “Daily Threads” or “Megathreads” on WallStreetBets. Comments thereby function as a better proxy for a minute-by-minute analysis of WallStreetBets sentiment on the stock metrics we perform the following regressions upon.
As only price and volume are metrics we managed to attain on a minute-by-minute basis, our regressions attempt to capture the relationship between returns against sentiment as well as volume against sentiment. The models we estimate are both constructed on an individual and aggregated stock basis. The individual minute-by-minute models can
be formulated as follows, where Return
Volume is the trading volume on stock i at minute k:
Returnk stock i = β0 + β1Comments per minutek + β2P ositive sentiment commentsk (4.21)
V olumek stock i = β0 + β1Comments per minutek + β2P ositive sentiment commentsk (4.22)
In the aggregated minute-by-minute models below, Return
minute k and Volume is the estimated volume on minute k. AMC has been arbitrarily
chosen as the baseline regressor, while the remaining tickers function as dummy variables. The aggregated minute-by-minute models can be formalized as follows:
Returnk = β0 + β1Comments per minutek + β2P ositive sentiment commentsk +β3TickerBB + β4TickerGME + β5TickerNOK
(4.23)
V olumek = β0 + β1Comments per minutek + β2P ositive sentiment commentsk +β3TickerBB + β4TickerGME + β5TickerNOK
(4.24) In the models we construct, the number of observations for return and volume can differ on the same stock. The reason for this phenomenon lies in how return is calculated. Return is calculated on the basis of the return in the previous observation. At some minutes in the sample no trades were done. The reason is that during the period we analyze in this section trading was frequently halted due to significant increased volatility

 and volumes. No trading at some minutes means that when calculating return the next minute a trade is done the return will be calculated as NA, as the previous price is missing. Rows with NA variables are not included in the regressions. Volume is an absolute number, meaning that all minutes that trades are done, volume will be treated as a non-NA variable. This explains the differences in the number of observations in the regression outputs in chapter 5.3.
4.6 Mention-weighted portfolios
To analyze what cumulative returns could be achieved by utilizing the number of stock mentions on WallStreetBets as a proxy for sentiment and implementing a trading strategy thereof, we constructed mention-weighted portfolios. To do so, we first summed the daily number of stock mentions for each individual stock in both submissions and comments to find the total number of stock mentions on WallStreetBets each day throughout the time interval of this thesis. Then we divided the daily number of mentions of each specific stock by the daily total of mentions of our selected stocks to mention-weigh the portfolios. The portfolios are all rebalanced daily, i.e. each day the relative stock weights adjust to changes in the relative mention-ratio among the stocks. The stocks’ relative weight in the mention-weighting portfolios can be written as:
Mention−weightedportfolio = no.mentions stock1 + no.mentions stock2 +... total no. mentions total no. mentions
(4.25) By mention-weighting the portfolios with daily rebalancing, this facilitates a theoretical approach to hypothesizing what return an investor would achieve if the investor monitored the sentiment on WallStreetBets daily and rebalanced the portfolio based on the relative mention-weights. The first of the mentioned-weighted strategies we developed is called “Mentions P”. This hypothesized strategy is based on using today’s mention-weights and implementing the strategy the same day. That means that the investor will enter positions equal to the relative mention-weights on WallStreetBets on a daily basis and get the return on the stocks the same day. The return of this daily rebalanced mention-weighting

To check for potential lagged effects of sentiment on return, we also constructed a mention-weighted trading strategy in addition to the strategy outlined above. This
lagged return strategy, i.e. strategy “Mentions P
return on day t is based on if you implement a trading strategy based on the relative mention-weights on WallStreetBets on day t, and then use stock returns on day t+1 as the foundation for calculating the strategy’s return. Practically, this implies that you calculate the relative mention-weights on WallStreetBets at the end of the day and implement these weights at the stock market opening the next day. This is probably the most feasible trading strategy to implement in reality. The daily return of this strategy can be formulated as follows:

We have also constructed two mention-weighted portfolios similar to Mentions P and
Mentions P
excluding these stocks from the portfolios. By constructing portfolios excluding these
mentioned-based heavyweights on WallStreetBets, the resulting portfolios better capture
the general effects mentions on WallStreetBets have had on a more general set of stocks.
These strategies are called MentionsX P and MentionsX P , respectively. The returns

of these strategies can be formalized as follows:

We have also added two control strategies. The first, called Market P, is to invest simply
in the value-weighted market portfolio, i.e. the Mkt.RF factor collected from French (2021). The daily return of this strategy is independent of relative mention-weights on WallStreetBets, and can be formulated as follows:
rt Market P = rt Mkt.RF (4.30) The second control strategy is to weigh the 18 stocks by relative value-weights instead of
mention-weights. This portfolio is also rebalanced daily, where daily market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the daily stock price against the number of shares outstanding at the given day. The return on this strategy, which we have called Market Weight P, can be formalized as follows:
rtMarketWeightP =rtstock1∗ marketcap.stock1t+rtstock2∗ marketcap.stock2t +...

To assess what happened when activity surrounding a stock was high, we wanted to perform an event study on the days with the highest relative individual stock mention ratio on WallStreetBets. To perform the event studies, we started by calculating the relative mention-weight for each stock each day between January 02, 2020, and March 12, 2021. The calculation was done by dividing the number of mentions considering the
(4.31)

4.7 Event studies 53
 specific stock both in submissions and comments by the total number of submissions and comments that day that could be connected to revolve around one or more stocks. Then we find which day this metric is at its highest for each particular stock. This day is then used as the basis for the further analysis.
Then we regressed the stock’s return on the market portfolio’s return, as well as the Fama- French factors SMB, HML, RMW, CMA to estimate the coefficients we then utilized to calculate the stock’s expected return that day. Column 5 in the tables containing the results, i.e. “Expected Return”, shows the calculated expected return based on these regression coefficients. The formula used for calculations of expected returns can be formulated as follows:
E (rt) = β0 + βMkt.RF rMkt.RF t + βSMBrSMB t + βHMLrHML t + βRMW rRMW t +βCMArCMA t
(4.33)
Abnormal return is defined as the return we observe over the expected return calculated
by a market model, in our case the Fama-French 5 factor model. Abnormal return, AR,
for stock i on day t can be formulated as follows, where r is the actual return of stock i
i,t
on day t and E(r ) is the expected return for stock i on day t:

t = ARi,t (4.35) σ
ARi,t = ri,t − E(ri,t)

5 Results
5.1 Market response to January 2021 rallies
In January 2021, many stocks with high short ratios experienced remarkably high returns, while many stocks with low short ratios experienced low or negative returns. Many of the stocks experiencing surging stock prices in January 2021 were subject to short and gamma squeezes, which parallelled a significant upturn in trading volume overall as investors all over the world established positions in the rallies to try to get their share of huge potential gains. In this chapter we will look into the difference in returns between the least and most shorted stocks on the Russell 3000 index from January 12 to January 29, 2021. This period was the most significant in terms of extreme returns, activity on WallStreetBets and media coverage, and serves as a starting point to visualize how the market reacted to the rallies in January 2021.

5.1 Market response to January 2021 rallies 55
 Figure 5.1 shows a plot of the return on the 100 least shorted stocks on Russell 3000 from January 12 to January 29, 2021, i.e. the most extreme rally period in the time interval we explore in this thesis when GME’s and other stock prices surged before trading restrictions effectively ended the rallies. The mean return of the 100 least shorted stocks on Wall Street was -5.86% in this period, and as the figure shows there were large variations in these stocks’ returns.
Figure 5.2: 100 most shorted stocks - Jan 2021
Figure 5.2 shows the return on the 100 most shorted stocks on Wall Street from January 12, 2021, to January 29, 2021. In contrast to the 100 least shorted stocks did the 100 most shorted stocks achieve a mean return of 33.65% in the same period. The extreme outlier in the far upper-right corner is GameStop, which achieved a return in this time period of a stunning 1,629%.
 
5.1 Market response to January 2021 rallies 56
  Figure 5.3: 100 most shorted stocks without GME - Jan 2021
As is shown in figure 5.3, even when excluding the effect of GME’s extreme return, the 100 most-shorted stocks after GME achieved a mean return of 17.54% between January 12 and January 29, 2021. This is remarkable compared to figure 5.1 with the 100 least- shorted stocks in the same period. Even when excluding the effect of GME’s extreme return in this period, the 100 most-shorted stocks outperformed the 100 least-shorted stocks by 23.4% in this period on average.
The cause of the large discrepancy between returns of the least and most shorted stocks can possibly be attributed to the short squeeze rallies, possibly attributed to WallStreetBets, during January 2021 and the snowball effect in the market. Normally the least shorted stocks would be expected to experience a higher return than those who are the most shorted. However, due to the extreme GME rally, when one institutional investor is margin called they need to rebalance by selling out of one of their long positions to cover their short. This then creates a snowball effect where more and more institutional investors need to rebalance, thus creating a price surge in the most shorted stocks, as well as a price drop in the least shorted stocks. Many of the stocks in the graphs above

5.1 Market response to January 2021 rallies 57
 were not prone to heavy discussions on WallStreetBets, but there are reasons to believe that since stocks with a high short interest were targeted, in order to hedge against risk, most institutional investors reduced their risk by reducing their existing short positions in what could be the next target of the retail investors.
5.1.2 Long short basket returns
Figure 5.4 and 5.5 show the difference in returns on Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ long baskets minus the returns on their short baskets, respectively. The figures show the extreme magnitude of the rallies we explore in this thesis. The time series in figure 5.4 goes back to 2007 and shows that the recent events led to the biggest restructuring since the financial crisis in 2008/09. The data from the Barclays’ long/short basket also illustrates the volatility and magnitude of the recent stock rallies and short squeezes. Goldman Sachs data only goes back to 2016, but still illustrates the compelling chain reaction of the rallies.

  Figure 5.5: Goldman Sachs long - short basket return
The figures in this chapter sets a precedent for how the market reacted to the rallies. It is hard to infer how much of the rallies can be attributed directly to WallStreetBets, but there is no doubt that many financial institutions were either directly or indirectly impacted by what occured in January 2021. In the following chapters we will try to measure WallStreetBets’ impact on several stock metrics, and assess whether or not we can link the rallies to the forum.

5.2 Sentiment regression results 60
 Although PLTR was one of the first stock rallies that was connected to WallStreetBets by the media, model (1) in table 5.1 indicates that none of the sentiment variables are statistically significantly correlated with PLTR’s return at the 5% level when looking at the time interval overall. The adjusted R-squared in this model is also remarkably low. Neither when introducing lagged return variables in table 5.2, nor when separating the time period into 2020 and 2021 in table A1.50 and A1.51, does sentiment appear to have had a statistically significant impact on PLTR’s return. The adjusted R-squareds in table 5.2, i.e. when introducing lagged return variables, nevertheless indicate that future returns are better explained than today’s return, but the adjusted R-squareds of all these models are very low.
Given the activity in media and on WallStreetBets for PLTR, this finding is interesting. We do not find any statistically significant relationship between WallStreetBets’ sentiment for PLTR and PLTR’s return. While none of the sentiment variables are statistically significant in the returns models, when using data for the entire time period in table 5.1 we observe that both Title per day and Title text per day are statistically significant at the 1% level in both model (4) and (5), indicating that sentiment may have had an impact on call and put option volumes. In addition, we observe that multiple sentiment variables are statistically significant in the volume model (2) in table 5.1. Even more striking, in table A1.49 with lagged volume variables we observe that there are statistically significant sentiment variables in all models except for model (4). While the adjusted R-squareds differ across the models and that the R-squared of the volume model today, i.e. model (2), is the highest, the findings in model (3), (5) and (6) indicate that sentiment on WallStreetBets for PLTR may have had an impact on volume the next day, two days on and four days on, respectively. The statistically significant variables in model (1) indicate that yesterday’s volume may partially explain sentiment today. We also observe statistically significant sentiment variables in the implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume models both in table A1.50 and A1.51, i.e. when the time period is separated into 2020 and 2021, respectively. The adjusted R-squareds in these models differ, but they are especially high for call and put option volume in 2020. Although we

5.2 Sentiment regression results 61
 may well deal with reverse causality problems here, the results do nonetheless suggest that sentiment may have had an impact on several of the stock and option metrics for PLTR. A word of caution is that there are relatively few observations for PLTR in general. The reason for this is that PLTR went public on September 30, 2020, meaning that the number of observations for 2020 is generally lower than for the other stocks in our sample.

   As with PLTR, the results for GME are somewhat surprising. Both PLTR and GME have been subject to massive media coverage and public debate, and WallStreetBets has by many been claimed to have made big impacts on these stocks’ returns. Contrary to what we initially believed when we began writing this thesis, we find that none of the sentiment variables are statistically significant in model (1) in table 5.3 where we analyze the effect of the sentiment variables on GME’s return over the entire time period. The adjusted R-squared of this model is also relatively modest with only 27.5%. Also, in table 5.4 with lagged return variables, none of the sentiment variables are statistically significant in any of the models. Interestingly, we observe that the R-squareds in models (3) and (4) in table 5.4 are higher than in model (2). This indicates that returns one and two days forward are better explained than returns today. While none of the sentiment variables are statistically significant at the 5% level, this is still an interesting finding since it can indicate that the models still capture some of the potential effects of sentiment on returns, although not enough to be statistically significant.
When analyzing the time period overall, in table 5.3 we observe that several of the
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 63
 sentiment variables are statistically significant at both the 1% and 5% level in model (2), (3), (4) and (5). Sentiment is therefore indicated to have had an impact on GME’s trading volume, implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume, respectively. When separating the time period into 2020 and 2021 in table A1.27 and A1.28, we observe statistically significant sentiment variables in model (2), (3), (4) and (5) in 2020, and
statistically significant sentiment variables in model (2), (3) and (4) in 2021. In general, this indicates that both in 2020 and 2021 has sentiment had an impact on trading volume, implied volatility and call option volume, while sentiment is only found to have had statistically significant impact on put option volume in 2020.
While we generally consider these option metrics to be less prone to reverse causality problems than stock returns, we advise to exercise more caution when looking at the results for trading volume. We do not believe that volume is as likely as returns to be prone to reverse causality problems, but we consider it to be higher than for the option metrics. The results we therefore observe for GME’s trading volume can be due to reverse causality. However, in table A1.26 with lagged volume variables, we observe that several sentiment variables are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level in both model (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5). This finding in model (1) indicates that yesterday’s volume has had an impact on sentiment today, while the findings in model (3), (4) and (5) suggest that sentiment on WallStreetBets for GME has had an impact on trading volume one, two and three days forward, respectively. Also interestingly, the adjusted R-squareds in model (3), (4) and (5) are all higher than the adjusted R-squared in model (2). The lagged volume models therefore better explain the variations in trading volume than the model considering variation in volume today. The magnitude of the coefficients are generally higher in model (2) than in the other models. Combined, these findings suggest that sentiment on WallStreetBets for GME has had an impact on trading volume, and the problem with reverse causality can potentially be smaller for trading volume than for the stock returns because sentiment a given day is found to have had a statistically significant impact on trading volume one, two and three days on. A general note when analyzing GME and WallStreetBets is that many of the forum members did not sell

5.2 Sentiment regression results 64
 the stock during the January rally, but are still hoping to this day to see similar price levels in the future. Therefore, as GME stock activity dropped off significantly from the peak, the forums interest in the stock persists and contrary to for example NOK who only captured the forum’s interest during the rallies, the models fail to capture the relationship where GME is still talked about to a large degree to this day without experiencing the same highs.
Yet another interesting finding from the individual stock regressions is that AAPL and GOOG generally have higher adjusted R-squareds in the Amihud-models than the other stocks in the sample. AAPL and GOOG are large companies in terms of market capitalization, which may be a contributing explanatory factor for this result. This finding may signal that liquidity is an important factor for these companies, since they are more affected by the market than by sentiment. Another interesting finding for these companies is that although some sentiment variables appear to be statistically significant in the return models on these large cap stocks, we would argue that is probably due to reverse causality. We observe a very low adjusted R-squared for AAPL in model (3) in table A1.2 and a very low adjusted R-squared for GOOG in model (3) in table A1.30. The magnitude of the coefficient Positive sentiment comments in model (3) in table A1.2 for AAPL is very low, and the coefficient on Title text per day in model (3) in table A1.30 for GOOG seems unreasonably high. Therefore, we would argue to exercise utmost caution when interpreting these results, as it seems unreasonable to believe that WallStreetBets have had any noteworthy effect on these stocks’ return.

       One of the most interesting findings in the individual stock regressions is the strong results for NOK. What makes the NOK example particularly interesting is the generally high adjusted R-squareds in the regressions. Model (2) in table 5.5 has an adjusted R-squared of 95.1%, meaning that it describes 95.1% of the variation in NOK’s trading volume. Also model (4) in table 5.5 has a very high adjusted R-squared of 96.7%, meaning
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 66
 that we also manage to explain most of the variation in call option volume. Even more interestingly, when introducing lagged volume in table 5.6 we observe in models (3) and (4) that the models explain approximately 90% of the volume each of the two succeeding days. The differences in adjusted R-squareds in the models using data for 2020 and those using data for 2021 are particularly interesting. While the adjusted R-squareds in 2020 are very low in general, they are remarkably high in 2021 with several adjusted R-squareds close to 98%. Although one should be cautious using this for inference, the striking difference in adjusted R-squareds from 2020 to 2021 may have some merit in describing the potential impact of sentiment on WallStreetBets on stock and option metrics. NOK surged in 2021, and these models carry important insights as to what may
have, at least partially, contributed to drive this surge.

   In terms of statistically significant correlation between sentiment and stock and option metrics, when using data from the entire time interval we find statistically significant relationships between up to several of the sentiment variables and NOK’s return, call option volume and put option volume. When using data for only 2020 the only statistically significant sentiment variable in any of the models is in model (1) in table 5.7, where Positive sentiment comments is statistically significantly correlated with NOK’s return at the 5% level. When using data for 2021 alone, the results are much stronger. Sentiment is indicated to have had a statistically significant impact on both trading volume, implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume, and the NOK example thereby serves as one of the clearest findings from the individual stock regressions.

   Another particularly interesting finding in the individual stock regressions is the results for NVDA. In the return model in table 5.9, Comments per day and Title per day are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level, respectively. The same model has an adjusted R-squared of 77.4%, which is relatively high compared to most of the other individual stock regression models. Mkt.RF, HML and CMA are also statistically significant at the 1% level in the model, giving reason to believe that these factors explain much of the relatively high adjusted R-squared. Comments per day is also statistically significant in the volume model, call option volume model and put option volume model. When limiting the data to 2020 alone, as is done in table A1.47, Comments per day and Positive sentiment comments are both statistically significant at the 5% level in the return model, and the adjusted R-squared increases to 80.1%. This is remarkably strong compared to its comparables, and also much higher than the adjusted R-squared in the return model when using data from 2021 alone in table A1.48. In the return model for 2021, we also observe that none of the sentiment variables are statistically significant. Also, the adjusted R-squareds in the 2021-based models are generally lower than the
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 69
 2020-based models. Comments per day is still statistically significant in the call option volume model, but there are no other statistically significant variables in any of the other models using data from 2021.
For NVDA, overall, the results are stronger for 2020 than for 2021, which is no surprise since NVDA was frequently discussed in 2020, but was replaced with e.g. GME, BB and AMC in 2021. Still, when combining the data for 2020 and 2021, as is done in table 5.9, sentiment is suggested to have had a statistically significant impact on return, volume, call option volume and put option volume. However, again, using these results to conclude that sentiment has had an causal effect on NVDA’s stock and option metrics is not necessarily correct both because we cannot rule out reverse causality in the models with lagged variables, and we do neither know how much of the total variation is explained by the return on the benchmark portfolio and Fama-French factors.

   Another particularly interesting finding from the individual stock regressions is found in table 5.10, which estimates the effect of the sentiment variables as well the benchmark portfolio and Fama-French factors on lagged return variables for RKT. Interestingly,

5.2 Sentiment regression results 70
 comparing adjusted R-squared in model (2) and (3), return tomorrow is better explained than return today, and Positive sentiment comments is the only statistically significant variable in model (3). This finding suggests that sentiment for RKT on a given day has had a statistically significant impact on RKT’s return the following day, indicating that sentiment might have driven future stock returns. In isolation, this indicates that WallStreetBets actually may exercise market power in terms of being able to move stock returns. Caution should be exercised when using this isolated result as a conclusion. The adjusted R-squared is still relatively low, and this isolated result gives no conclusive evidence on whether WallStreetBets actually exercises market power.

   When comparing model (2) and (3) in table 5.11, i.e. in the lagged volume models for RKT, we also observe that volume tomorrow is better explained by sentiment today. The adjusted R-squared in model (2) is 62.9%, while the adjusted R-squared in model (3) is 79.7%. There are no statistically significant variables in neither of the models, but the difference in adjusted R-squared in the two models is still interesting. The difference in explanatory power between 2020 and 2021 is also striking. All models except the Amihud model in table A1.59, where data for only 2021 is used, have higher adjusted R-squareds than their comparables in table A1.58, i.e. when using data for only 2020. No sentiment variables are statistically significant in the 2021-based models, so we do not argue that
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 71
 sentiment is found to have had an impact on the stock and option metrics for RKT in 2021. We still want to highlight this particular finding, because RKT experienced a significant surge in February 2021 when it was frequently discussed at WallStreetBets. The generally higher adjusted R-squareds in the models for 2021 compared to 2020 seem to capture this feature, although the models fail to indicate any statistically significant impact of the sentiment variables on this.

   Furthermore, the results for TSLA are especially interesting. Throughout 2020 and the beginning of 2021 TSLA’s stock price surged, and the market capitalization of the company has seen a dramatic rise. As of May 23, 2021, TSLA’s market capitalization is larger than the combined market capitalization of the four next largest automakers by market capitalization (CompaniesMarketCap.com, 2021). TSLA has also been one of the most frequently discussed stocks on WallStreetBets for a long time. Given the large market capitalization of TSLA as well as WallStreetBets’ interest in TSLA , the results for TSLA are particularly interesting. In model (1) in table 5.12, Positive sentiment comments is statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating that sentiment may have
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 72
 had an impact on TSLA’s return when using data for the entire time interval. Model (3), (4) and (5) also contain several statistically significant sentiment variables. This is a striking finding, indicating that sentiment may have had an impact on TSLA’s implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume, respectively. Although the adjusted R-squareds of these models are relatively low, these results nonetheless indicate that sentiment on WallStreetBets actually may have had affected these option metrics, as well as TSLA’s return. However, this may again be a result of reverse causality. In table A1.70 with lagged return variables, we observe that return today in model (2) has a much higher adjusted R-squared than any of the other lead or lag variables. One should pay
particular attention to the extreme drop in adjusted R-squared from model (2) to (3), which can be argued to indicate reverse causality. Positive sentiment on WallStreetBets a given day for TSLA may therefore mirror TSLA’s returns that day, meaning that we are unable to distinguish what has affected what. This may also be true for the option metrics. We therefore advise to exercise caution when using these results, although there are several statistically significant sentiment variables in the different models for TSLA.
5.2.1.2 General trends
We find that sentiment is indicated to have had a statistically significant effect on several of the stocks’ returns. When introducing leading and lagged return variables, we observe for some stocks that the estimated effect of sentiment on return is limited to be statistically significant only in the models with return for the same day. These findings on returns where especially the variables describing positive sentiment are statistically significant, instead of comment frequency, may therefore indicate reverse causality problems, i.e. a stock’s return a given day may explain the sentiment on WallStreetBets for the stock the same day, not vice versa. As such, we cannot conclude that sentiment has had a causal effect on several of the stocks’ returns even though we find that one or more of the sentiment variables are statistically significant with several of the stocks’ returns the same day.
On the other hand, we observe several stocks where sentiment variables are statistically

5.2 Sentiment regression results 73
 significant on one day, but also experience a higher adjusted R-squared the succeeding days which might suggest WallStreetBets sentiment could actually drive stock returns. We therefore cannot exclude that this relationship holds either, i.e. sentiment can potentially have had an actual impact on stocks’ returns. Not being able to distinguish between these relationships, we advise to exercise caution when interpreting the results in the regression tables. While we find that sentiment may have had an impact on some of the stocks’ returns, the effect of sentiment on volume seems in general to be stronger than the effect of sentiment on returns. We find that sentiment variables are often statistically significant in the volume models in the individual stock regressions, and for several of the stocks we also observe that sentiment on WallStreetBets on a given day may have had an effect on the trading volume the following days. In general, therefore, volume seems to be more sensitive to sentiment on WallStreetBets for more of the stocks than returns. However, again, we argue to exercise caution when making inference with these results.
The strongest pattern in the individual stock regressions is that sentiment appears to have had a general effect on the option metrics, i.e. implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume. Most often we find statistically significant sentiment variables in the option-related models, which indicates that sentiment on WallStreetBets actually may have had a larger effect on these metrics than stock returns and trading volume. As we previously have discussed, users on WallStreetBets often advocate to trade in options instead of trading in the stocks directly, and these findings are therefore particularly interesting as they also seem to apply to more stocks than returns and trading volume. However, we have not applied any lagged option-related variables, so these results can also potentially be a result of reverse causality, but we would argue that this is much less likely to be a problem for the option metrics than for return. The pattern is nevertheless stronger than for returns and trading volume, which is indicative of a more general effect of sentiment on these metrics. Also, the adjusted R-squareds in these models are generally very high compared to the other metrics’ models. Therefore, we find that the effect of sentiment on any of the metrics we analyze in this thesis is indicated to be strongest on implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume. When dividing the results

5.2 Sentiment regression results 74
 into 2020 and 2021, we find that the results differ. While the return, trading volume and option metrics are better explained for some stocks in 2020, these metrics are better explained for other stocks in 2021. This is no surprise, since there are large variations as to when the different stocks have been heavily discussed on WallStreetBets. For example, AMC, BB, NOK and GME, which all were heavily discussed on the forum in 2021 in general have the strongest results in 2021, while others, such as NVDA, in general have the strongest results in 2020. Remark, however, that there are large differences also at the individual stock level which year the different models yield the strongest results in.
5.2.2 Sentiment variables on an aggregated stock sample
Having performed analyses on each of the stocks individually, in this subchapter we will perform analyses on the stock selection overall. First, we will perform an analysis on the time period overall. Then, we will present a regression table with lagged return variables. Next, a regression table with lagged volume is presented. Thereafter, we present a regression table based on data from only 2020 to see whether the sentiment variables display statistically significant correlations with return or the other stock metrics. Lastly, we repeat the process we did for 2020, but replace the data with data from only 2021. This makes us able to compare potential changes and trends from one year to the other, in addition to making comparisons of whether sentiment can be claimed to partially explain more of variation in the stock and option metrics in one year rather than the other.

   Table 5.13 is a regression output with categorical variables, which is based on the entire time period being subject for analysis in this thesis, i.e. January 02, 2020, to March 15, 2021. When aggregating the stocks in a general regression model, we observe in model
(1) that Positive sentiment comments and Positive sentiment title both are statistically
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 76
 significant at the 1% level, and Positive sentiment title text is statistically significant at the 5% level. All the statistically significant sentiment variables indicate a positive effect on returns. In addition, we observe that all the statistically significant variables are direct measures of the positive sentiment in the comments, submission titles or submission texts, not variables explaining the frequency of submissions and comments being made about the stocks in our sample. Positive sentiment is therefore indicated to have had an impact on stocks’ return overall, even when controlling for that Mkt.RF, SMB and HML are all significant at the 1% level, while the CMA factor is statistically significant at the 5% level.
The positive coefficient on the SMB factor indicates that small companies are relatively over-weighted in our sample. The negative coefficient on the HML indicates that the firms in our sample generally have low book-to-market ratios, while the positive coefficient on the CMA factor indicates that firms with conservative investment policies are relatively over-weighted in the sample.
The stock-specific categorical variables differ in terms of statistical significance. The adjusted R-squared of 9.1% is also relatively low. When taking into account the illiquidity factor AMIHUD in model (6), we can infer that a larger variation of the returns could potentially be explained by liquidity rather than WallStreetBets sentiment and Fama- French alone. Overall, the results nonetheless suggest that sentiment has had an impact on stocks’ return, but the magnitude of the coefficients on the statistically significant sentiment variables indicate that the effect of sentiment on stock returns in general is relatively low. However, we cannot conclude directly that sentiment has had an impact on stock returns, since these effects may be a result of reverse causality, especially considering that positive sentiment might be attributed to positive returns on the day stocks are discussed. We have not included any lagged variables in this model, meaning that we are unable to distinguish whether sentiment has had an impact on returns or vice versa. Therefore, although model (1) indicates that sentiment has had an impact on stock returns overall, we are unable to use this as conclusive evidence for sentiment having had a causal effect on stock returns.

5.2 Sentiment regression results 77
 In model (2) in table 5.13, we observe that Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are statistically significant at the 1% level, while Positive sentiment comments is significant at the 5% level. All categorical variables except TickerPLTR are significant at the 1% level. The adjusted R-squared of this model is 44.8%, indicating a higher explanatory power than model (1). The statistically significant sentiment variables generally suggest a positive impact on trading volume, although the net stock-specific effect when controlling for the general negative coefficient on the categorical variables is not clear-cut. However, the model nevertheless suggests that sentiment has had an impact on trading volume, and sentiment seems to better explain variations in trading volume. When not controlling for lagged volume variables, we are unable to distinguish between whether trading volume drives sentiment or whether sentiment drives trading volume. In general, therefore, we advise to exercise caution when interpreting this result in isolation.
The option-related models, i.e. model (3), (4) and (5), all contain statistically significant sentiment variables. They also generally display higher adjusted R-squareds than the stock-related models, i.e. model (1) and (2). In the implied volatility model, i.e. model (3), Positive sentiment comments, Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are all statistically significant at the 1% level, while Title per day is significant at the 5% level. The coefficients on Title per day, Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are positive, while the coefficient on Positive sentiment comments is negative. The total net effect on implied volatility is therefore not clear, but the model nevertheless suggests that sentiment in general has had an impact on implied volatility. In model (4), all statistically significant sentiment variables have positive coefficients, indicating that positive sentiment has had a positive effect on call option volume. This finding is interesting, since WallStreetBets often is flooded by posts encouraging its users to trade in call options. Bear in mind, that the net direction of the effect is not clear-cut given the general negative coefficient on the categorical variables. In model (5), the only statistically significant sentiment variable is Positive sentiment comments, which is significant at the 1% level. The direction of the coefficient is negative, indicating that

5.2 Sentiment regression results 78
 increased positive sentiment lowers put option volume, which is the direction one in general would intuitively expect to observe.
As with model (1), the results from these option-related models, i.e. model (3), (4) and (5), can be results of reverse causality problems. We do not know whether sentiment drives the option metrics or whether the variations in the option metrics drive sentiment. However, we would argue that the effect of sentiment on these option-related metrics
in general seems stronger than the effect on the stock-related metrics. The adjusted R- squareds are generally much higher in the option-related models, which we also observed in the individual stock regressions, and we would also argue that the problem of reverse causality in general in these models seems less likely than in the stock-related models. Although highly possible due to both direct or indirect effects, we believe that investors’ sentiment for a stock is generally less affected by variations in implied volatility and option volumes than returns and trading volume. Note, that variations in implied volatility and option volumes can create spillover effects on stock returns and trading volumes and thereover on sentiment, so we cannot statistically rule out this possibility. Still, we would argue that this seems less likely than for the stock-related metrics, and this relationship therefore seems in general to be stronger than in the stock-related models.

   In table 5.14, we introduce lead and lag return variables to examine the effect of sentiment on WallStreetBets on stocks’ return. In the previous section, where there were no lead or lag return variables, we found that several sentiment variables were statistically significant, but whether this was due to sentiment actually having had an impact on returns or
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 80
 whether this was a result of reverse causality problems was unclear. When applying lead and lag variables we facilitate a more comprehensive analysis of the general effect of sentiment on returns.
Positive sentiment comments is statistically significant at the 1% level in model (1) in table 5.14. Also Mkt.RF and CMA are statistically significant at the 1% level in this model. This indicates that sentiment on WallStreetBets on a given day may be influenced by the previous day’s returns, but the adjusted R-squared of this model is very low with only 4.4%. Model (2) is the same model as model (2) in table 5.14 in the previous section, and shows that several sentiment variables are statistically significantly correlated with today’s return, while the adjusted R-squared of this model is 9.1%. In model (3) we observe that Positive sentiment comments and Positive sentiment title text both are statistically significant at the 1% level, also when controlling for the fact that Mkt.RF, HML and CMA are statistically significant at the 1% and that the SMB factor is statistically significant at the 5% level. The adjusted R-squared in model (3) is also higher than the adjusted R-squared in model (2). Overall, these findings suggest that sentiment on WallStreetBets on a given day may have had an impact on stocks’ return the next day, and we are able to explain more of the variation in returns’ the next day than the same day. These findings are particularly interesting when we account for the fact that the Fama-French factors have not been lagged, thus we can attribute more of the results we see to the actual sentiment on WallStreetBets. Even though the adjusted R-squared is low, these results give more indicative evidence that sentiment on WallStreetBets may have had an effect on stock returns on an aggregated basis. We also observe statistically significant sentiment variables in model (4), (5) and (6), which indicate that sentiment on WallStreetBets on a given day also can explain variations in returns two, three and four days forward, respectively. It is important, however, to note that the adjusted R-squareds in these models are generally very low.
Overall, these findings suggest that sentiment on WallStreetBets a given day may explain same day stock returns, but the problem of reverse causality is a critical drawback factor for making this conclusion. When introducing lagged variables, we observe that sentiment

5.2 Sentiment regression results 81
 on WallStreetBets a given day may have had an impact on stock returns over the next days and that the direction of this effect is positive. Since we have applied lagged return variables, we are able to control for parts of the reverse causality problems, which makes these results more robust than the results for the effect of sentiment on same day’s returns. We are not able to completely rule these out, and the generally low adjusted R-squareds also suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting these results. In general, these results do nonetheless give more indicative and striking evidence on sentiment on WallStreetBets having had an impact on stock returns.

5.2 Sentiment regression results 82
 In table 5.15 we have introduced lead and lag volume variables. We observe that model (2) has several statistically significant sentiment variables, and has also the highest adjusted R-squared of the models with 44.8%. This indicates that sentiment on WallStreetBets a given day has had the highest impact on the same day’s trading volume. Model (1) also contains several statistically significant sentiment variables, indicating that the preceding day’s volume can partially explain sentiment on WallStreetBets the next day. We would argue that high volume the previous day does not itself seem like an intuitive explanatory factor for sentiment on WallStreetBets the next day, but knowing that high volume is often observed when returns are high, this finding can potentially reflect parts of the previous day’s returns’ effect on the next day’s sentiment on WallStreetBets.
Another interesting finding in table 5.15 is that both Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are statistically significant at the 1% level in model (3), and that the adjusted R-squared of this model does not stand much back from the adjusted R-squared in model (2). This indicates that sentiment on WallStreetBets one day may have an effect on the next day’s trading volume. Both of these statistically significant sentiment variables have positive coefficients, indicating that positive sentiment on WallStreetBets a given day is associated with an increase in the trading volume the next day. In other words, positive sentiment for stocks on WallStreetBets appears to induce people to trade more heavily the next day. Although the adjusted R-squareds in model (4), (5) and (6) fall from model (2) and (3), they also all contain statistically significant sentiment variables, meaning that this positive effect of sentiment on volume seems to sustain over the next few days. This is interesting since it suggests that the sentiment itself on WallStreetBets has had an impact on trading volume, not the frequency of submissions and comments posted on the forum. While the finding is not surprising, it carries important insights for the comprehensive understanding of the effects of sentiment on WallStreetBets.

   Model (1) in table 5.16 shows that four of the sentiment variables are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level in 2020, while also the return on the benchmark portfolio and all the Fama-French factors except RMW are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level. The adjusted R-squared of this model is relatively low, however,
∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01

5.2 Sentiment regression results 84
 with only 10.7%. The net direction of the coefficients on the statistically significant sentiment variables in model (1) is ambiguous, as the coefficients on Positive sentiment comments, Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are all positive, while the coefficient on Title text per day is negative. In model (2) we observe that Comments per day, Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are significant at the 1% level, and that the direction of the coefficients are all positive. Although this indicates that both the number of comments and the sentiment in the submission texts and submissions titles have had a positive effect on trading volume, the magnitude of the coefficient on Comments per day seems unrealistically high as it suggests that an increase of one comment on the forum considering a stock in the sample increases the trading volume with over 16 800 shares. The categorical variables may control for parts of this effect, but we would argue that this estimated coefficient seems to be too high. Also implied volatility, call option volume and put option volume are all indicated to have been affected by sentiment on WallStreetBets in 2020. The adjusted R-squareds of these models are generally much higher than the adjusted R-squared in the return model (1), indicating that these findings can potentially be more robust than the associated impact of sentiment on stocks returns in 2020.

   The regression output in table 5.17 is based on data from 2021 alone. In model (1) we observe that Positive sentiment comments and Positive sentiment title are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level, respectively. Compared to the adjusted R-squared in model (1) in table 5.16 where data from 2020 was used, we observe that the adjusted

5.2 Sentiment regression results 86
 R-squared has increased in this model when using data from 2021. We also observe that neither the return on the benchmark portfolio nor any of the Fama-French factors are statistically significant except the CMA factor, which is in sharp contrast to the findings when using data from only 2020. The direction of the coefficients in model (1) in table 5.17 indicates that sentiment has had a positive effect on return in 2021, while the net effect of sentiment on stock returns in 2020 was unclear given the negative coefficient on Title text per day in model (1) in table 5.16. Overall, therefore, sentiment is suggested to explain more of the variation in stock returns in 2021 compared to 2020, and the direction of the effect of sentiment in 2021 is not as ambiguous as it was in 2020 when the net direction of the coefficients on the sentiment variables was unclear.
In model (2) in table 5.17 we observe that Positive sentiment title and Positive sentiment title text are statistically significant at the 1% and 5% level, respectively. Mkt.RF is also statistically significant at the 5% level. While Comments per day was statistically significant in model (2) when using data from 2020 alone, this is no longer significant when using data from only 2021. This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that each comment in 2020 was indicated to potentially have had an impact on trading volume. Note, however, that the magnitude of the coefficient in 2020 seems unreasonably high, but this finding generally points towards that the heightened level of posts on WallStreetBets in 2021 compared to 2020 overall made each comment relatively less important, while the overall sentiment in the submissions became relatively more important factors for explaining variations in trading volume. Also note that the adjusted R-squared falls in model (2) in 2021 compared to 2020, but the magnitude of the drop is small.
Title per day and Positive sentiment title text are the only statistically significant variables at the 5% level in model (3) using data for 2021. The adjusted R-squared of this model is 83.9%. This indicates that sentiment can be argued to explain much of the variation in implied volatility for the stock sample in 2021, and the adjusted R-squared is also relatively much higher in 2021 compared to 2020. The adjusted R-squareds in model (4) and (5) fall from 2020 to 2021, but there are several statistically significant sentiment variables in the models both from 2020 and 2021. The impact of sentiment on call and

5.3 Minute-by-minute regressions 87
 put option volume therefore seems to apply to the stock sample also on an aggregated basis, which is a particularly interesting finding as it seems more robust than the findings on stock returns. Option strategies are commonly discussed on WallStreetBets, and users are frequently advocating to trade in options instead of stocks directly so as to maximize potential gains per dollar invested. This common practice on the forum is indicated to have had a general impact on option volumes in both 2020 and 2021, and is one the most striking findings in these regressions.
5.3 Minute-by-minute regressions
AMC, BB, GME and NOK were all subject to massive discussion on WallStreetBets and media coverage during the rallying weeks between January and February 2021. In this subchapter we will analyze potential effects of sentiment on WallStreetBets on these stocks’ return and trading volume on a minute-by-minute basis between January and February 2021. Using comments data on WallStreetBets on a minute-by-minute basis and combining this with return and volume data facilitates an unique opportunity to analyze if activity and sentiment had immediate effects on the mentioned stocks’ return and trading volume.
For the regressions in this chapter, Comments per minute is the number of comments posted on WallStreetBets concerning the specific stock a given minute.

5.3 Minute-by-minute regressions 88
 In table 5.18 we assess the effect of real-time WallStreetBets sentiment on a minute-by- minute basis from January 19, 2021 to February 3, 2021. Unfortunately due to missing data, we cannot assess the days leading up to the peak on January 25 and 26 which would be extremely interesting to analyze, although we have the data surrounding these dates. When looking at the return for the stocks, we can see a remarkably low adjusted R-squared on all of the models, meaning sentiment has little explanatory power when it comes to return. Only for the GME return do we see a statistically significant relationship with the Comments per minute variable above the 5% level, indicating that comment frequency might have a small effect on returns.
Further, from the Comments per minute variable we observe a statistically significant relationship on all of the stocks’ volume, with a strong correlation. These results indicates that forum participants discussing the stock might also buy the stock at the same time. Interestingly, GME compared to the others has a lower t-value on the variable than the other stocks, although still very significant, but also a significantly lower adjusted R-squared of only 3% compared to the other stocks hovering around 20%. This might indicate that GME was driven by other external forces rather than WallStreetBets exclusively, or it could be due to the fact that GME was mentioned in general more than the other stocks, as well as having a higher price inducing a higher barrier of entry, thus many forum participants holding the stock could be talking about the stock without actually buying more. Alternatively, since GME experienced one of the largest short squeeze rallies in history, we cannot rule out that other market participants also took part in the rallies.
When looking at how positive sentiment affected volume, we observe in model (6) and (8) that the variable is statistically significant at the 1% level for both GME and NOK, but that their directions differ. For GME, positive sentiment seems to reduce stock volume, whilst for NOK positive sentiment has a positive relationship with stock volume. Although it is hard to infer why GME has a negative relationship between positive sentiment and volume, this might simply be a result of how some words in the dictionary such as “Diamond hands”, which was frequently used during the surges, have a positive

5.3 Minute-by-minute regressions 89
 dictionary score, but was mostly used when the stock was experiencing negative returns to signal that even though the stock is dropping, the forum members will not sell the stock.

When aggregating the data in a factor regression, we observe many of the same trends
observed in table 5.18. For returns, both sentiment variables seem to have a slightly positive relationship with returns, yet they are not statistically significant enough to infer any real relationship between the variables, which ultimately would be supported by the negligible adjusted R-squared of 0.1%. On the other hand, all our sentiment variables as well as the ticker factors are statistically significant at the 1% level for volume, with strong t-values indicating that the correlation is strong. Compared to GME on an individual basis, positive sentiment overall seems to have a positive relationship with
Note:

5.3 Minute-by-minute regressions 90
 stock volume. With an adjusted R-squared of about 20.5%, we can say that a decent proportion of the volume variation can be explained by WallStreetBets sentiment.
5.3.3 Interpretation
Ultimately, there does not seem to be a clear relationship between WallStreetBets sentiment and returns on a minute-by-minute basis. However, volume seems to be affected to a larger degree with an adjusted R-squared on the aggregated sample of 20.5%, as well as statistically significant sentiment variables. There is no clear confirmation from this data alone on whether WallStreetBets were the catalyst for the rallies or if the forum simply served as an echo chamber intensifying the discussions around the stocks in question. Ultimately, from the data we have analyzed we cannot from a statistical perspective conclude that WallStreetBets has not had an impact on the rallies we observed in January 2021.
Although we have not found a statistical relationship for returns on a minute-by-minute basis, there are some indications of a causal relationship between WallStreetbets sentiment and indirect stock price increases for the selected stocks in the sample. Since many of the stocks subject to the rallies had large short interests, a volume increase in these stocks with a positive direction meant that many investors who were short had to exit their positions by buying shares, thus fueling these rallies even more. With the findings from the individual regressions, indicating that sentiment on WallStreetBets also increases call option volume (see table A1.10, table A1.25, table 5.8 and table A1.28), one could infer that this has also lead to an increase in the price when stocks have surged and market makers have had to gamma hedge, thus more stocks have been bought which in combination with shorters being squeezed out of their positions have lead to the surges we have observed.

5.4 Mention-weighted portfolios 91
 5.4 Mention-weighted portfolios
In order to better assess whether stock activity on WallStreetBets could be translated to potential returns we constructed mention-weighted portfolios consisting of all the stocks in our sample. This way we could visualize how stock activity on the forum translated into stock movements, and see whether following WallStreetBets investment advice could yield better or worse returns than the market portfolio.
Figure 5.6 graphs the value of investing USD 100 from January 02, 2020, to March 12, 2021, by using the different trading strategies we developed in chapter 4.6.
Figure 5.6: Portfolio simulation - January 02, 2020, to March 12, 2021
Figure 5.6 shows that Mentions P gives the highest overall return during the time interval. Although the strategy is somewhat theoretical, it gives an indication of what returns
 
5.4 Mention-weighted portfolios 92
 could be achieved by monitoring the sentiment on WallStreetBets a given day and implementing a mention-weighted portfolio the same day. We would like to underscore that the calculated return on this portfolio should be used as an indication, not as a definite result given that the strategy has its drawbacks. The main drawback is that sentiment and returns can change over the course of the given day, but both returns and sentiment are based on the returns and accumulated sentiment over the whole day. However, we would nevertheless argue that the results still may have some indicative merit. The figure indicates that by investing USD 100 on January 02, 2020 using this strategy, on March 12, 2021 this would have become USD 944.34, implying a return of 844.34%. We also see that MentionsX P yields the second highest return, a remarkable return of 573.46%, which is particularly interesting given that we have taken out the effects AMC, BB, GME and NOK.

A general note to the results in this subchapter is that a large portion of the return in 2020 is explained by Tesla, a WallStreetBets favorite, which has experienced a higher percentage share of mentions than its market value weight. However, the tables highlight

5.5 Event studies 95
 that using mention-weighted trading strategies can yield potentially very high returns.
Strategies Mentions P and MentionsX P yield total returns of 844.34% and 573.46% over
the entire time interval respectively, but we once again underscore that these should be
used as indications for a hypothesized return, not definite returns given the previously
discussed drawbacks of these strategies in practice. The more realistic strategies to
implement in practice, Mentions P and MentionsX P , yield lower returns over the
t+1 t+1
entire time interval, but still higher returns than the market portfolio and the value- weighted stock portfolio in 2020. A final remark when looking at the results presented in this chapter is to note that most of the stocks in our sample have experienced some kind of a surge during the time period, and subsequently the stocks are not necessarily representative of a mention-weighted portfolio consisting of a broader set of stocks. Overall, mention-weighted strategies may have some merit, and they may potentially yield extremely high returns.
5.5 Event studies
In this subchapter, we will perform event studies on 11 of the 18 stocks in this thesis’ list of stocks subject to analysis. The 7 remaining event studies are found in the appendix’ chapter A3. These studies enable a more in-depth analysis of whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had statistically significant impacts on individual stocks’ return. The event studies seek to calculate and test for abnormal return of stocks in the period they are relatively most mentioned at WallStreetBets. The rationale behind this is to analyze whether an abnormal return is achieved on the same day, or up to two prior or succeeding days from this day, as the stock is relatively most mentioned. We do not seek to do an event study with a hold-out window, and an event window spanning multiple days, rather, we want to explore what movements occur on the days surrounding activity peaks.
In the following tables, the day at which the relative mention-weight is at its peak is the observation in the middle of the tables. The two upper observations are the two trading days before the main observation, while the two lower observations are the two subsequent trading days to the main observation.

As can be observed in the tables above, 8 out of the 11 stocks display statistically significant abnormal return on the day they peak in terms of relative mention-weight. 4 out of 11 stocks display statistically significant abnormal return two days prior to their respective relative mention-peak, while also 4 out of 11 stocks display statistically significant abnormal return one day prior to their respective relative mention-peak. Only 2 out of 11 stocks display statistically significant abnormal return the subsequent day to their respective relative mention-peak, and 2 out of 11 stocks display statistically significant abnormal return two days after their respective relative mention-peak. These results indicate that on the respective days the stocks subject for analysis in this subchapter reached their relative mention-peaks, most of them display a statistically significant abnormal return. 4 out of the 8 stocks with statistically significant abnormal returns on the same day as their respective mention-peaks have a negative abnormal return, while the other 4 stocks have a positive abnormal return. These results might suggest that activity is not driven entirely by positive market news, but mentions can also be high when stocks are experiencing negative returns. A characteristic of the forum, originating from their high risk strategies, has long been to celebrate large losses as well as large gains, so these results might serve to emphasize this distinction.
In sum, the event studies indicate that on days where the stocks were relatively much discussed on WallStreetBets, most stocks displayed abnormal returns the same day. Note, however, that we have only analyzed the exact date +/- two days at which the relative mention-weight for each stock reached its peak in the time interval we explore in this thesis. Also, abnormal return may itself be a reason for a stock being heavily discussed on WallStreetBets, not vice versa. As underlined with our regressions, positive sentiment,

5.5 Event studies 99
 rather than pure activity, seems to be the main correlation between returns and forum influence which could be a result of reverse causality. The results for the two days prior to or succeeding the date at which the stocks reached their relative mention-peaks therefore could give a more valuable insight into how sentiment is generated on the forum. All of the 4 stocks displaying statistically significant returns the day prior to the relative mention-peak have positive abnormal returns. While not statistically proven, this indicates in isolation that a stock’s prior return on the previous day may be reflected in the relative mention-weight on WallStreetBets the next day.

 6 Conclusion
6.1 Conclusion
In this thesis, we have tested whether sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum has exercised some form of market power during the research period. By applying in-depth sentiment analysis techniques combined with financial data, we find ambiguous results on whether or not WallStreetBets have had an impact on stock returns in the time interval we have limited this analysis to. For some individual stocks we find that WallStreetBets sentiment has had a statistically significant impact on returns, and that returns can also be explained for succeeding days. On the contrary, for other stocks we observe only statistically robust relationships between positive sentiment and returns the same day, and for the same stocks we can observe a significant drop off in adjusted R-squared when we lag the returns. These findings may suggest that for many of the stocks in our sample we cannot rule out the effect of reverse causality, but for other stocks in our sample returns can be partially explained by sentiment on the forum. On an aggregated basis only the sentiment variables connected to positive sentiment are statistically significant, which again suggests a problem of reverse causality, alongside a low adjusted R-squared. We therefore cannot rule out that a large proportion of the variation in returns is explained by our control variables, and that sentiment has had a small impact on returns today. However, when supplementing the model with lagged variables we find that sentiment today better explains returns tomorrow even when accounting for non-lagged control variables. These findings might suggest there is some merit to the notion that WallStreetBets actually has the ability to influence stock returns.
While sentiment on WallStreetBets does not have a clear relationship with return, the correlation is stronger when looking at volume. For many individual stocks we see that when activity and positive sentiment is high, volume has a positive relationship with the sentiment variables. Only 4 out of the 18 stocks we analyzed in this thesis did not have any statically significant relationships between sentiment and volume. Overall, the results

6.1 Conclusion 101
 differ on an individual basis, where for some stocks, stock volume can be explained to a larger degree than for others. On an aggregated basis can WallStreetBets sentiment be claimed to explain a moderate portion of volume variations, with the degree of positive sentiment being the most correlated explanatory variable with volume. Overall, we can not attribute all the observed volume variations to WallStreetBets, but the relationship is still significant enough to conclude that when a stock is frequently discussed on the site, forum members or observers tend to trade the affected stock.
When testing the impact of sentiment on WallStreetBets on the option-related metrics, we find that sentiment explains relatively much of the variation in stocks’ implied volatility, call option volume, and put option volume. In general, these effects seem to be larger than the general effect of sentiment on volume and return. Both when analyzing these metrics on stocks individually and on an aggregated basis, the effect of sentiment on WallStreetBets on these metrics is the most prominent finding of sentiment on any of the factors we have sought to analyze in this thesis.
When assessing whether WallStreetBets can be attributed to have impacted the January 2021 rallies, we find in our minute-by-minute regressions that much of the variation in volume can be attributed to WallStreetBets sentiment. Although we did not find any statistical relationships between return and sentiment when looking at real-time impacts, we could infer that the increased volume as a result of WallStreetBets sentiment could have an indirect effect on the returns for the affected stocks.
In the thesis, we have also shown that the most-shorted stocks on Russell 3000 achieved substantial gains on average in January 2021, while the least-shorted stocks on average achieved a negative return. We also observed how this impacted two of the largest financial institutions’ returns, leading to a restructuring between short to long baskets not seen since the financial crisis in 2008. In our view, this could be the direct, or indirect result of WallStreetBets activity.
We have also found that many of the stocks in the thesis achieved abnormal returns at their relative mention-peaks. In addition, we have shown that implementing trading

6.1 Conclusion 102
 strategies based on mention-weights on WallStreetBets could have yielded remarkable returns in the period we have explored. This underscores the effect of sentiment on WallStreetBets on stock returns, as it shows that by investing in stocks frequently discussed on the forum, one could potentially have achieved large returns. To what extent these strategies would be possible to implement in reality has been discussed, and they differ in terms of both returns and practical feasibility.
In sum, we would argue that sentiment of WallStreetBets has had a measured effect on several of the stock metrics we have researched, thus we would conclude that the forum does hold some form of market power. For returns, the results are ambiguous and we can not draw any clear empirically grounded conclusions based on our analysis alone. For volume, the relationship is clearer and indicates that when stocks are subject to WallStreetBets activity, more people trade the stocks. Finally, for the option-related metrics we can conclude that WallStreetBets has had a direct effect on implied volatility as well as call and put option volume. Although it is unclear how strongly they have influenced the market just by this analysis alone, it would be hard to claim that WallStreetBets have not had a decisive role in the magnitude of the rallies we have analyzed in this thesis.
Our mission has not been to identify causal relationships between sentiment on WallStreetBets and stock metrics, but to investigate whether sentiment on WallStreetBets can be claimed to have had an isolated impact on these metrics. Sentiment is found to have had a statistically significant impact on several of the stock metrics, but one can not use this study to conclude that sentiment, therefore, has a causal relationship with these metrics. Our results suggest that sentiment explains variations in these metrics, not that sentiment tells the whole story. Therefore, we would advise exercising caution when making inferences with the results in this thesis.

6.2 Limitations and suggestions for future research 103
 6.2 Limitations and suggestions for future research
In this thesis, we have not sought to explain through what exact mechanisms sentiment on WallStreetBets has translated into statistically significant correlations with returns, volume, and option-related metrics, but rather to investigate whether sentiment on WallStreetBets has had an impact on these metrics overall. This means that we have not sought to explain whether the observed movements in returns, volume, and option-related metrics can be attributed to either retail or institutional investor activity. Although retail investors are believed to make up the majority of the forum’s users, institutional investors may well have been monitoring sentiment on WallStreetBets and implemented trading strategies thereof. A suggestion for further research is therefore to drill into stock and option markets order flows and analyze who has been driving the movements in returns, stock volumes, and option volumes in the thesis’ selected time interval.
Also, we have limited our analyses to describing the effect of sentiment on WallStreetBets alone, not incorporating sentiment data from other sources. The media’s coverage of the rallies in January/February 2021 was massive, which possibly contributed significantly to fuel those rallies. However, we have not analyzed the effect of media coverage nor the sentiment in news articles in this thesis. Neither have we incorporated data from any other social media platform than WallStreetBets. A suggestion for further research is therefore to apply the insights from this thesis and supplement these with models linking e.g. media coverage, sentiment in news articles, and data from other social media to financial data to analyze what effects sentiment in these platforms had on stock returns, volume, implied volatility and option volumes, and whether WallStreetBets serves as a catalyst to media sources or if the forum simply serves as an echo chamber for potential rallies. Although we have not only sought to look at whether the forum influenced the rallies in this thesis, the potential omitted variable bias introduced by excluding these external factors on the January 2021 rallies cannot be ignored.
A limitation on how the WallStreetBets data is collected was based upon how the Reddit API does not allow direct access to its data. Thus, with pushshift.io being the best

6.2 Limitations and suggestions for future research 104
 alternative we had for data extraction, there were still days not present in our dataset. Most notably, data from January 25 and 26, 2021 was missing from the dataset, vital days in terms of explaining how sentiment was able to fuel the short squeeze rallies experienced during the end of January 2021. The missing days might be linked to the fact that WallStreetBets went private on January 27. As imputing this data would alter our results, these dates are not included in any portion of our analysis. We did an experiment to control for their omitted effects by constructing regressions where sentiment on January 27 was assigned to the two preceding days, which demonstrated that the missing data thankfully did not change our overall results in a significant way. As the majority of the missing data were linked to days in 2021, research revolving around that year in isolation could be flawed and should be interpreted with that in mind.
Our original idea was to capture the overall effect of WallStreetBets where we tried to identify all stocks with CRSP share code 10 and 11 from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ from our WallStreetBets dataset. However, due to computational limits and time constraints, we could only look at a sample of stocks. A suggestion for future research is therefore to research WallStreetBets effect on all stocks that are mentioned on the forum, and see whether the measured effect can be larger for smaller stocks that experience lower volumes. These could be more prone to manipulation or so-called pump-and-dump schemes than the more popular stocks we have taken on in this thesis. This would also allow the creation of more thorough portfolios to assess whether trading strategies originating from the forum could have merit to it.
We opted to exclude weekend activity from our research as the drop in activity would suggest fewer participants on the forum, and thus a lower overall potential market effect. Incorporating this data in future research could potentially result in a clearer picture of WallStreetBets’ influence on the market overall.
Finally, we look forward to seeing what literature spawns in the future surrounding this topic, and hope to have contributed at least partially to the emerging theory surrounding the democratization of finance and investment forums’ influence on the financial markets.

Abstract
In this paper we present a theory and some empirical evidence on stock price manipulation in the United States. Extending the framework of Allen and Gale (1992), we consider what happens when a manipulator can trade in the presence of other traders who seek out information about the stock’s true value. In a market without manipulators, these information seekers unambiguously improve markete ciencybypushingpricesuptothelevelindicatedbytheinformedparty’sinformation. In amarketwithmanipulators,theinformationseekersplayamoreambiguousrole. Moreinformation seekers imply greater competition for shares, making it easier for a manipulator to enter the market and potentially worsening market e ciency. This suggests a strong role for government regulation to discourage manipulation while encouraging greater competition for information. Using a unique dataset, we then provide evidence from SEC actions in cases of stock manipulation. We find that potentially informed parties such as corporate insiders, brokers, underwriters, large shareholders and market makers are likely to be manipulators. More illiquid stocks are more likely to be manipulatedandmanipulationincreasesstockvolatility. Weshowthatstockpricesrisethroughout the manipulation period and then fall in the post-manipulation period. Prices and liquidity are higher when the manipulator sells than when the manipulator buys. In addition, at the time the manipulator sells, prices are higher when liquidity is greater and when volatility is greater. These results are consistent with the model and suggest that stock market manipulation may have important impacts on market e ciency.

1 Introduction
“In multiple instances, the large orders [the defendant] placed were filled in smaller blocks at succes- sively rising prices. All of these transactions, the Commission alleges, were part of a manipulative scheme to create the artificial appearance of demand for the securities in question, enabling uniden- tified sellers to profit and inducing others to buy these stocks based on unexplained increases in the volume and price of the shares.”
— Securities and Exchange Commission1
Both for developed and emerging stock markets, the possibility that the markets can be ma- nipulated is an important issue for both the regulation of trading and the e ciency of the market. Manipulation can occur in a variety of ways, from insiders taking actions that influence the stock price (e.g., accounting and earnings manipulation such as in the Enron case) to the release of false information or rumors in Internet chat rooms. Moreover, by purchasing a large amount of stock, a trader can drive the price up. If the trader can then sell shares and if the price does not adjust to the sales, then the trader can profit. Of course, we should expect that such a strategy will not work. Selling shares will depress the stock price, so that, on average, the trader buys at higher prices and sells at lower prices. This is the unraveling problem, and would seem to rule out the possibility of what Allen and Gale (1992) term trade-based manipulation.
In this paper, we examine various forms of stock market manipulation and their implications for stock market e ciency. Allen and Gale (1992) have shown that trade-based manipulation is possible when it is unclear whether the purchaser of shares has good information about the firm’s prospects or is simply trying to manipulate the stock price for profit. We examine this question in a setting in which there are active information seekers (think of arbitrageurs) trying to ferret out information about the firm’s prospects. In general, information seekers improve market e ciency and manipulators reduce market e ciency. Surprisingly, we find that increasing the number of information seekers may worsen market e ciency when there are manipulators present. Because the information seekers compete for shares, increasing the number of information seekers will increase the manipulators’ profit, thereby making manipulation more likely. Thus, the possibility of stock price manipulation may substantially curtail the e ectiveness of arbitrage activities, and, in some cases, render arbitrage activities counterproductive. In these situations, the need for government

regulation is acute. In particular, enforcement of anti-manipulation rules can improve market e ciency by restoring the e ectiveness of arbitrage activities.
We then establish some basic facts about stock market manipulation in the United States. We construct a unique dataset of stock market manipulation cases by analyzing SEC litigation releases from 1990 to 2001. There are 142 cases of stock market manipulation that we are able to identify. Our analysis shows that most manipulation cases happen in relatively ine cient markets such as the OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets that are small and illiquid. There are much lower disclosure requirements for firms listed in these markets and they are subject to much less stringent securities regulations and rules. We find that manipulated stocks are less liquid than a matched sample of non-manipulated stocks, supporting the notion that average volume is low for manipulated stocks. However, during the manipulation period, liquidity, returns, and volatility are higher for manipulated stocks than for the matched sample. The vast majority of manipulation cases involve attempts to increase the stock price rather than to decrease the stock price, consistent with the idea that short-selling restrictions make it di cult to manipulate the price downwards. We also find that “potentially informed parties” such as corporate insiders, brokers, underwriters, large shareholders and market makers are likely to be manipulators. Since they are close to the information loop, it is much easier for them to pose as the informed party in a manipulation scheme.
Using these data, we then examine the empirical implications of the model. As far as we know, our study is the first to test models of stock market manipulation using a comprehensive sample of cases. Because they constitute the vast majority of cases, we focus on situations in which the manipulator first buys shares and then sells them. We show that stock prices rise throughout the manipulation period and then fall in the post-manipulation period. In particular, prices are higher when the manipulator sells than when the manipulator buys, suggesting that the unraveling problem does not apply in practice. After the manipulation ends, prices fall. These results are consistent with the model. We find some evidence that liquidity is higher when the manipulator sells than when the manipulator buys. Strikingly, at the time the manipulator sells, prices are higherwhenliquidityisgreater. Thisresultisconsistentwithreturnstomanipulationbeinghigher when there are more information seekers in the market. Also, at the time the manipulator sells, prices are higher when volatility is greater. This result is consistent with returns to manipulation being higher when there is greater dispersion in the market’s estimate of the value of the stock. All of these results are consistent with the model.

Thereareseveralcaveatstonoteabouttheseresults. First,weonlyhavedataformanipulation cases in which the SEC brought an enforcement action. We therefore miss cases in which 1) manipulation is possible but does not occur, 2) manipulation happens but is not observed, and 3) manipulation happens, the SEC investigates, but does not bring an action. Thus, it can be argued that our results only apply to poor manipulators in the sense that they were caught. While this point is true for our descriptive results, it does not a ect the empirical tests of the model because we only test cross-sectional implications that would hold for manipulators. In particular, one would have to argue that a manipulator who manipulates a more liquid or more volatile stock is more likely to be caught than one who manipulates less liquid and less volatile stocks. This seems somewhat implausible since it would be easier to hide trades in more liquid and more volatile stocks.
Second, we have a relatively small number of cases of manipulation. However, as far as we know, ours is the first study to systematically examine instances of stock market manipulation in the U.S. using a comprehensive sample of actual manipulation cases. Even given the noisiness and imprecision of the data, we are able to find fairly striking results on the characteristics of manipulation cases. One might argue, however, that manipulation is relatively unimportant in U.S. stock markets. We disagree for several reasons. First, because we can only focus on cases in which the SEC has acted, we do not have a clear picture on how prevalent manipulation is. In particular, given concerns that the SEC’s enforcement budget is quite limited, the small number of cases may only be a reflection of budget constraints. Second, even if manipulation is a small issue in U.S. markets, manipulation may be a much larger issue for emerging stock markets. Anecdotal evidence from conversations with Chinese securities regulators suggest that price manipulation is a significant impediment to the development of the Chinese securities markets. Third, given the number of recent manipulation cases involving the use of the Internet, the Internet may be an important channel that makes manipulation through information dissemination easier. Fourth, we believe that our results for manipulation cases may also be useful for thinking about similar issues when it comes to larger cases of fraud such as Enron or Worldcom.
There is a large literature on market microstructure that examines whether informed traders such as insiders can trade profitably.2 Our paper examines whether a manipulator can distort the

stock price away from its true value and profitably trade on this distortion. Van Bommel (2003) looks at situations in which traders can spread rumors in the market about their trades. Van Bommel shows in a Kyle (1985) setting that a potentially informed trader with limited wealth can raise her trading profits by pretending to be informed even when she is not. He also shows that a potentially informed trader would prefer to commit to not trading against her own information (i.e., buying when the true value is low), in contrast to our finding that a manipulator distorts prices against his information. Van Bommel’s focus is on the dissemination of information by gurus, analysts, investment newsletters, and other potentially informed parties. Our paper focuses on manipulation of stock prices with a specific emphasis on cases of illegal manipulation. While some of the results of the two models are similar (e.g., manipulators pretending to be informed when they are not), van Bommel’s model does not directly apply to cases of illegal manipulation.
Allen and Gorton (1992) argue that the natural asymmetry between liquidity purchases and liquidity sales leads to an asymmetry in price responses. If liquidity sales are more likely than liquidity purchases, there is less information in a sale than in a purchase because it is less likely the trader is informed. The bid price then moves less in response to a sale than does the ask price in response to a purchase. Allen and Gorton (1992) argue it is much more di cult to justify forced purchasing by liquidity traders who have a pressing need to buy securities. This asymmetry of price elasticities can create an opportunity for profitable price manipulation. As a result, a manipulator can repeatedly buy stocks, causing a relatively large e ect on prices, and then sell with relatively little e ect.
In our model, we do not rely on the asymmetry of price elasticities to motivate the possibility of manipulation. Instead, we assume, consistent with Allen and Gorton’s (1992) observation, that liquidity traders are willing to sell at prices higher than the current or prevailing price. Moreover, there is no forced buying by liquidity traders in our model. The buying of shares in our model comes from arbitrageurs or information seekers acting rationally, whose presence allows for the possibility of manipulation.
Allen and Gale (1992) also examine trade-based manipulation. They define trade-based manip- ulation as a trader attempting to manipulate a stock simply by buying and then selling, without taking any publicly observable actions to alter the value of the firm or releasing false information to change the price. They show that a profitable price manipulation is possible, even though there is no price momentum and no possibility of a corner. The key to this argument is information asym-
4

metry. Traders are uncertain whether a large trader who buys the share does so because he knows it is undervalued (including the possibility of a takeover), or because he intends to manipulate the price. It is this pooling that allows manipulation to be profitable. Our model has a similar result. We di er from Allen and Gale (1992) in that we incorporate information seekers or arbitrageurs into our model and ask what e ect they have on the possibility of manipulation.
In a dynamic model of asset markets, Jarrow (1992) investigates market manipulation trading strategies by large traders in a securities market. A large trader is defined as any investor whose trades change prices. A market manipulation trading strategy is one that generates positive real wealth with no risk. Market manipulation trading strategies are shown to exist under reasonable hypotheses on the equilibrium price process. Profitable speculation is possible if there is “price momentum,” so that an increase in price caused by the speculator’s trade at one date tends to increase prices at future dates. Our model can be viewed as providing a mechanism by which price momentum occurs—our information seekers trade rationally based on what they observe about the large trader’s buying activity.
There also exist a large number of papers that examine theoretically and empirically price manipulation in a number of di erent settings. For example, Kumar and Seppi (1992) investigate the susceptibility of futures markets to price manipulation. Jordan and Jordan (1996) examine SalomonBrothers’marketcornerofaTreasurynoteauctioninMay1991. FelixsonandPelli(1999) examine closing price manipulation in the Finnish stock market. Mahoney (1999) examines stock price manipulation leading up to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Vitale (2000) examines manipulation in the foreign exchange market. Gerard and Nanda (1993) examine the potential for manipulation in seasoned equity o erings. Jarrow (1994) studies the impact that derivative security markets have on market manipulation. Merrick, Naik and Yadav (2003) examine a case of manipulation involving a delivery squeeze on a bond futures contract traded in London. Khwaja and Mian (2003) analyze a unique data set containing daily firm-level trades of every broker trading on the stock exchange in Pakistan over a 32-month period. They find evidence that brokers manipulate price to profit from positive feedback traders.
Relative to the existing literature, our paper makes three contributions. First, we extend the Allen and Gale (1992) model to generate testable implications about the evolution of the prices, volume and volatility in cases of stock market manipulation. Second, we construct a unique dataset of cases of manipulation in U.S. equity market. Third, we provide some of the first sample based
5

tests of models of stock market manipulation.
This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present a model of stock price manipulation.
In Section 3, we describe our data and present some basic empirical results. Section 4 presents the empirical tests of the model. Section 5 concludes. Some technical details are provided in the Appendix.
2 Model
We consider a simple model of stock price manipulation. There are four types of investors in our model. First, there is an informed party (superscripted I) who knows whether the stock value in the future will be high (VH) or low (VL). We can think of the informed party as being an insider in the firm who has good information about the firm’s prospects.
Second, there is a manipulator (superscripted M), who we assume knows that the stock value will be low. The manipulator tries to drive the price of the stock up and then profit by selling at the higher price. In our model, we consider two scenarios. First, the manipulator can take some actionsuchasspreadingrumorsorengaginginwashsalestoincreasethestockprice. Thisactivity, while generally prohibited by law, constitutes most cases we observe of stock price manipulation. Second, the manipulator can buy shares and then profit by trying to sell them later at a higher price. The issue for the manipulator is whether such a strategy is sustainable. In general, such a strategy would su er from the unraveling problem—in meeting the manipulator’s demand, the price is driven up so the manipulator buys at a higher price while when clearing the manipulator’s supply, the price is driven down so the manipulator sells at a lower price. Allen and Gale (1992) show that this need not happen in general and it may be possible for the manipulator to sustain positive profits. We apply their insights in our context and show that profitable manipulation is possible and, in addition, we show its impact on market e ciency. In our model, the manipulator may also be an insider, but one who does not have good information about the firm’s future prospects.
Third, there are N symmetric information seekers (superscripted Ai, i   N). Information seekers seek out information about whether the future stock price will be high or low. One can also think of them as being arbitrageurs. In our model, we limit our information seekers to several types of information. They can observe past prices and volume and they are susceptible to rumors that may be spread. They do not know the identities of buyers and sellers and therefore they
6

are susceptible to the possibility of wash sales. They have no access to fundamental information themselves. Instead, they try to infer from prices, volumes, and rumors whether an informed party is buying the stock, or whether they should be buying the stock as well.
Fourth, there exists a continuum of noise or uninformed traders (superscripted U). These traders do not update or condition on any information. They simply stand ready to sell shares, so their role is to provide liquidity to the market. We model the uninformed traders as providing a supply curve to the market that determines the market price:
P (Q) = a + bQ, (1)
where P is the market price of the stock, Q is the quantity demanded, and b is the slope of the supply curve. We assume that initially all shares are held by the uninformed traders.3 If no one wishes to purchase the stock, then the price of the stock is simply a. For completeness, we assume that the total shares outstanding are:
VH  a. (2) b
This implies that if someone wished to buy all of the shares from the uninformed, the price would be VH. It is important to note that this is not because the uninformed update about the stock’s value. Instead, it is simply governed by the uninformed’s willingness to sell more if o ered a higher price.
The timing of the model is as follows. At time 0, all shares are held by the uninformed. At time 1, either the manipulator or the informed party can enter the market. The manipulator enters with probability  , and the informed party enters with probability  .4 Since the informed party will only enter if the future stock value will be high (VH), this is equivalent to saying the probability the future stock value is high is  . Here we assume that the manipulator knows he does
not have good information and the future stock value is VL.5 With probability 1         neither
3 This is the case for trading based manipulation. In the cases of wash sales and the release of false information
or rumors, the manipulator already owns shares and thus comprises part of the supply curve.
4This is the case if the manipulator engages in trade-based manipulation. If the manipulator already has a
position in the stock, then   is the probability that the manipulator releases false information or engages in a wash sale.
5It is worth noting that the manipulator will not always try to manipulate the stock when the informed party does not enter. If the probability of manipulation is too high, then the market will break down in the sense that information seekers will not be willing to purchase shares. This explains why a manipulator who already owns shares may nonetheless choose not to try to manipulate the stock.
7
  
the manipulator nor the informed enter and the future stock value is VL. As a result, we can think of a as being the time 0 price, i.e., the unconditional expected value of final cash flows,
a= VH +(1  )VL. (3)
The information seekers observe the stock price and the quantity demanded or any relevant rumors or false information at time 1. At time 2, information seekers can buy shares. They will condition the number of shares they purchase on what they observed at time 1.6 Also at time 2, the manipulator or the informed party can buy or sell shares. At times 1 and 2, the uninformed stand ready to sell shares. At time 3, the fundamental stock price is revealed to be either VH or VL.
Wemakeanadditionalassumptionabouttheinformedparty. SimilartoAllenandGale(1992), we assume that the informed party dislikes holding shares until time 3. We can think of this in severalways. First,time3representsthelong-run,whenstockpriceshaveadjustedtofundamental values. The long-run may be very long, and thus it may be costly to hold shares for the informed party. Second, if the informed party is an insider, holding a large, undiversified position in the own-firmstockiscostlyfromaportfoliodiversificationperspective. Thoughthereisnouncertainty in our model, by adding some uncertainty about the distribution of time 3 prices, we can easily motivate a cost to holding shares for the informed party. We model the cost of holding shares until time 3 as a scalar k. If the stock price at time 3 is VH, the value to the informed party of a share isVH  k. Inorderforourproblemtobemeaningful,itmustbethecasethatVH  k a>0, otherwise no informed party would ever buy shares at a price greater than or equal to the time 0 price and hold them until time 3. There is no cost for the informed party to holding a share until time 2. Note that there is no such cost to the manipulator to holding shares until time 3 because the manipulator will never hold shares until time 3 when the value of the share will be VL, conditional on the manipulator entering.
Wenextconsidertwocases. First,weexaminewhathappenswhenaninformedpartyispresent
6 If there is no purchase of shares at time 1, it is natural to assume that the information seekers will short sell the stock at time 2 until its value is driven to VL (subject to there being a large number of information seekers). Our focus here is on what happens when there is a purchase of shares at time 1.
One may also wonder why the manipulator and the informed party, knowing that the stock value is low, do not short sell to take advantage of this information. First, with regard to the manipulator, our results would go through if we assumed that the manipulator was uninformed about the true value of the stock. Second, if both the informed party and the manipulator are insiders (as is true in most cases of manipulation), then restrictions on insiders short-selling their own firm’s stock will prevent them from taking advantage of their information.

2.1 An Economy with Information Seekers but no Manipulator
First, we consider what happens when there are N symmetric information seekers present in the market, but no manipulator. The information seekers condition their demand at time 2 on what they observe at time 1. Here there are two potential equilibria. In the first equilibrium, the informed party purchases shares at time 1 and then sells these shares at time 2 to the information seekers, who purchase additional shares from the uninformed.7 In the second equilibrium, the informed party purchases shares at time 1 and then both the informed party and the information seekers purchase additional shares from the uninformed at time 2. In general, we think that the first equilibrium represents the usual case, as we discuss below.
Theinformationseekersareinthemarketattime2. Giventhattheinformationseekersobserve the trading activity at time 1, they know that the informed party has good information about the firm’s prospects (VH). Each information seeker also knows that she is competing against the other N   1 information seekers for shares. Lastly, the informed party’s strategy at time 2 must be optimal given the information seekers’ demands for shares. In this equilibrium, the conjectured optimal strategy for the informed party is to sell shares at time 2, which we will then verify as optimal. We denote the aggregate demand of the N information seekers at time 2 as:
qA =XqAi, (4) 22
i N
where qAi is each information seeker i’s demand at time 2. At time 2, all shares outstanding are
2
available for purchase as the informed party sells her q1I shares.8 Each information seeker i solves
the following problem at time 2:
max VHqAi  (a+b(XqAi))qAi. (5) qAi 2 22
2 i N
7 This is the case we focus on when we add manipulators to the market. For this reason, it is also worth thinking about what happens when the informed party already has shares. In this case, the informed party will want to release credible information about the true value of the shares at time 1 and then sell shares at time 2. For now, because there are no manipulators present, any information released is credible.
8 We show below that as long as there is at least one information seeker (N   1), the aggregate number of shares demanded by the information seekers at time 2 will exceed the number of shares sold by the informed party, q2A > q1I .
9
 
Taking the N first order conditions, imposing symmetry, and solving yields:
qAi = VH a. (6)
2 (N + 1)b The aggregate demand from the N information seekers is:
  The price at time 2 is:
qA = N VH a. (7) 2N+1b
p  =a+b(XqAi)= NVH +a. (8) 22N+1
 i N
As the number of information seekers becomes large, the aggregate demand converges to all of
the shares outstanding and the time 2 price converges to the fundamental value of the stock:
limqA  = VH a N   2 b
lim p 2 = VH. N  
In this sense, the information seekers push the market to e ciency.
if the number of information seekers is large. If the number is small, then the information seekers do not push the market all the way towards e ciency as each tries to extract rents. Only when the number is large is the ability to extract rents circumscribed by the competition from the other information seekers.
Under the conjectured equilibrium, the informed party purchases shares at time 1 and sells at time 2. The informed party chooses the number of shares to purchase at time 1 by solving the following problem:
max p 2q1   (a + bq1)q1. (11) q1
(9) (10)
 The time 1 quantity demanded by the informed party is:
qI = N VH a, (12)
and the price is:
The informed party’s profits are:
1 N+12b
p 1=a+ N VH a. (13)
N+1 2
I  N2 (VH  a)2
 =(N+1)2 4b. (14)
10
This is true, of course, only
    
In this conjectured equilibrium, the equilibrium strategies are for the informed party to buy qI  shares at time 1, for the informed party to sell qI  shares at time 2, and for the N information
11
seekers to each buy qAi  shares at time 2. We now examine under what conditions this conjectured 2
equilibrium will, in fact, be an equilibrium. In order for this conjectured equilibrium to be an equilibrium, it must be the case that no party benefits by deviating from the strategies conjectured. Suppose first that the informed deviates by trying to buy additional shares at time 2 rather than sell. Aggregate demand for shares at time 2 is then:
qA +qI +qI = N VH a+ N VH a+qI 2 1 2 N+1b N+12b 2
= 3NVH a+q2I. (15) N+1 2b
   Note that for N   2, the total quantity demanded (assuming q2I   0) exceeds the number of shares outstanding, VH  a . In this case p  = VH and the time 2 demand of the informed party is qI = 0.
b22
The value to the informed party for holding shares until time 3 is VH   k. The informed party’s
profits from this deviation are:
N2 (VH  a)2 1N(VH  a)·(VH  a)  ̧
(N+1)2 4b +2 (N+1)b (N+1)  k . (16)
The first term is just the profits earned by not deviating from the equilibrium. The second term is the incremental profit from deviating. For N or k large enough, the second term is negative, establishing that the deviation is not profitable and the conjectured equilibrium is, in fact, an equilibrium. Further, each of the information seekers’ strategies that we solved for was optimal given all of the other information seekers’ strategies and the informed party’s strategy, so no information seeker will deviate.
There is also a second equilibrium that has the feature that the informed party buys in both periods. Paralleling the development above for the first equilibrium, for this equilibrium to be sustainable, it must be the case that the number of information seekers N or the cost of waiting to time 3 for the informed party k is small enough. For completeness, in Appendix A, we derive the equilibrium. The relevant condition for this equilibrium is that the informed party must prefer to hold shares until time 3 rather than sell them at time 2. From Appendix A, this condition is:
V H   k   p  2 = ( N + 2 ) ( V H   k   a )   2 k N 2   4 k N > 0 . ( 1 7 ) 2(3+N2 +4N)
The key point that emerges from this condition is that as long as k is small or N is small, the expression will be positive and the informed party will prefer to purchase shares in both periods.
11
     
Note that as N increases, eventually the expression switches sign and becomes negative. The informed party will cease buying shares at time 2.
The results here show that information seekers have two opposing e ects on the profits of the informed party relative to the benchmark case. First, the information seekers compete with the informed party for shares at time 2. This reduces the informed party’s information rents. Second, if the competition is su ciently intense in the sense that there are a large number of information seekers, then the informed party’s strategy will switch and the informed party will sell shares to the information seekers at time 2. This was the first equilibrium derived above. This makes the informed party better o  as the informed party no longer incurs the cost of holding shares until time 3. In general, we think of N as being su ciently large that the first equilibrium represents the usual case.
2.2 An Economy with a Manipulator and Information Seekers
Next we consider what happens when there is also potentially a manipulator present, in addition to the information seekers. For simplicity, we assume that the manipulator only enters if the informed does not enter, conditional on manipulation being profitable. In this case, the manipulator is present with probability  . The information seekers continue to condition their demand at time 2 on what they observe at time 1. In this case there is a multiplicity of equilibria. We discuss the pooling equilibrium here and a separating equilibrium in Appendix B.
We begin by conjecturing that the manipulator and the informed party pool in their strategies. That is, we conjecture that they buy the same quantity of shares at time 1 and sell these shares at time 2. This conjectured equilibrium is similar to the first equilibrium from the previous subsection.9 If the manipulator and the informed party choose to purchase the same number of shares at time 1, then the information seekers’ posterior beliefs that the purchaser of the shares is the manipulator are:
 =   . (18)  + 
Each information seeker i solves the following problem at time 2, conditional on observing a purchase
9 If the manipulator and the informed party already own shares at time 0, then the alternative interpretation of these results is that the manipulator and the informed party release information at time 1 with probabilities   and   respectively, and then sell at time 2. The manipulator’s information release is false and the informed party’s information release is true.

 Under the conjectured pooling equilibrium, if either enters, the informed party and the manipulator both purchase shares at time 1 and sell shares at time 2. Both the informed party and the manipulator choose the number of shares to purchase at time 1 by solving the following problem:
max p 2q1   (a + bq1)q1. (24) q1
The time 1 quantity demanded by the informed party and the manipulator is:

  In order for this pooling equilibrium to be sustainable, it must be incentive compatible for the informed party not to deviate and thus separate from the manipulator. Purchasing a di erent
13

quantity of shares at time 1 but still selling them at time 2 will not be su cient to break the pooling equilibrium because it is costless for the manipulator to mimic this strategy. Moreover, as the information seekers only observe the quantity and price from time 1, there is no credible way for the informed to commit to holding shares until time 3.10 Thus, in order for the pooling equilibrium to be sustainable, the incentive compatibility condition reduces to checking that the informed party will want to sell shares at time 2 rather than hold them until time 3. The value to holding shares until time 3 for the informed party is VH  k, so the incentive compatibility condition is:
p 2=a+ N ((1  )VH+ VL a) VH k. (28) N+1
Rearranging this condition and substituting for a and   from equations (3) and (18), we get the
following:
k  1 μ(1  )+N   ¶(VH VL). (29) N+1  + 
In order to sustain a pooling equilibrium in which both the manipulator and the informed party buy qM  = qI  shares at time 1 and sell them at time 2, this incentive compatibility condition must
be met.
Examiningtheincentivecompatibilityconditionyieldsthefollowingcomparativestatics. First,
the greater the cost k of holding shares until time 3, the easier it is to sustain the pooling equi- librium and the more likely it is the informed party will pool with the manipulator. Second, it is straightforward to see that the right hand side of the condition is increasing in  , implying that the greater the probability that the purchaser of shares at time 1 is a manipulator, the less likely it is the informed party will pool with the manipulator. The intuition here is that the greater the probability that the purchaser is a manipulator, the more severe the adverse selection problem for the information seekers, causing them to reduce the number of shares they purchase at time 2. As a result, the price the seller receives at time 2 is lower, making it less likely that the informed will pool with the manipulator. Similarly, the right hand side of the condition is decreasing in  , the probability that the purchaser of shares is the informed party. The more likely that the purchaser is informed, the easier it is to sustain pooling.
Third, note that the right hand side of the condition is increasing in VH   VL. The greater
10In the case of the release of information, the ability of the manipulator to appear as credible as the informed party is crucial, otherwise the pooling equilibrium cannot be sustained. This also suggests that in many cases, the manipulator cannot credibly release false information and rumor-based manipulation will fail.

the dispersion between the high value and the low value of the firm, the less likely it is that the informed party will pool with the manipulator. The greater the dispersion, the more valuable it is for the informed party to wait until time 3 and get the high value for the firm.
Fourth, an increase in the number of information seekers N increases the likelihood of pooling. To see this, note that the right hand side is decreasing in the number of information seekers. More informationseekersimprovesthepricethatthepurchaserofsharesgetsattime2. Thus,increasing the number of information seekers makes it more likely that the incentive compatibility condition is met and the equilibrium is the pooling equilibrium. Interestingly, the e ect of this is that increasing the number of information seekers reduces market e ciency by reducing the revelation of information.
Because of this e ect, there is a substantial and important role for government regulation. In the absence of a manipulator, the usual e ect of increasing the number of information seekers is to enhance market e ciency by pushing the time 2 price towards its true value. In the presence of a manipulator, this is no longer necessarily true. Our second comparative static result above shows that decreasing the probability   of a manipulator being present (or, more precisely, decreasing the conditional probability   of a manipulator being present) increases the likelihood of successful manipulation. However, our expression for the time 2 price,
p 2=a+ N ((1  )VH+ VL a), (30) N+1
shows that decreasing the conditional probability   of a manipulator being present also increases the e ciency of the time 2 price. Thus, to the extent that government regulation and enforcement decreases the probability of a manipulator being in the market, this leads to greater market e ciency even though it makes manipulation more likely to be successful when manipulation occurs.
A number of other equilibria may exist as well. We discuss one of these, a separating equilibria, in Appendix B. We focus on the pooling equilibrium here in the text because it has the key feature we are interested in — manipulation successfully occurs in equilibrium. In the pooling equilibrium, the manipulatorisabletomimicthestrategyoftheinformedparty. Insuchanequilibrium,thetime2 price cannot converge to the high fundamental value of the stock because the information seekers do not know if the purchaser of shares or releaser of information at time 1 is informed or a manipulator. As we expect, the possibility of manipulation worsens market e ciency. Interestingly, increasing thenumberofinformationseekersincreasesthelikelihoodthatthereismanipulation. Theintuition for this result is that increasing the number of information seekers makes the informed party more
15

willing to sell shares at time 2 rather than holding them until time 3. Having the informed party sell shares at time 2 is a key condition for allowing the manipulator to enter the market.
2.3 Empirical Implications
We now consider some empirical implications of our model. While the model generates many testable implications, we focus here on those implications that we actually are able to test given our data. As a result, there are many implications left which represent potentially fruitful avenues for future research. All of the implications we test are for the pooling equilibrium assuming the manipulator has entered the market.
First, we consider the time path of prices.
Prediction 1: Prices increase throughout the manipulation period and then fall when the true value is revealed.
Mathematically, p3 < p0 < p 1 < p 2. This prediction is intuitive. The manipulator’s demand for shares at time 1 raises the price relative to time 0. At time 2, when the manipulator sells, the information seekers are in the market, and their demand exceeds the manipulator’s supply, which is how the manipulator is able to profit. At time 3, the value of the shares is revealed and the price falls to its true value. This prediction will also be true of many models of successful manipulation such as Allen and Gale (1992), Jarrow (1992) and van Bommel (2003). However, this prediction stands in contrast to the unraveling problem, which predicts the price at time 2 is lower than the price at time 1, as well as the model of Allen and Gorton (1992).
We now consider the impact of the information seekers on volume. Our model predicts volume
is greater when the manipulator sells (in the second period) than when the manipulator buys (in
the first period), q  < qA . It also predicts that volume in both periods is increasing in the number 12
of information seekers,  q / N > 0 and  qA / N > 0. The more information seekers there are in 12
the second period, the more they will buy in the aggregate because they compete with each other for shares. If the manipulator knows that he can sell more shares in the second period because there are more information seekers, then he will buy more shares in the first period. However, the manipulator does not buy one-for-one. Trying to sell too many shares in the second period will drive the information seekers from the market. As a result, the model predicts that the volume di erential between the second period and the first period will be increasing in the number
of information seekers,   ¡qA    q ¢ / N > 0. We do not directly test these predictions. Instead, 21
16

these predictions suggest we can use volume as an instrument for the number of information seekers in the market. As a result, our test using volume will be joint test of these predictions as well.
Next, we consider the impact of information seekers and value dispersion on returns.
Prediction 2: Returns are increasing in the number of information seekers,   (p 2   p 1) / N > 0 a n d   ( p  2   p 0 ) /   N > 0 .
This prediction is central to our story — more information seekers increase the manipulator’s return, where we proxy for information seekers by the level of volume.
Prediction 3: Returns to the manipulator are increasing in the dispersion of the true value of t h e s t o c k ,   ( p  2   p  1 ) /   ( V H   V L ) > 0 a n d   ( p  2   p 0 ) /   ( V H   V L ) > 0 .
Intuitively, if there is little disagreement or uncertainty about the true value of the stock, then there is little room in which the manipulator can operate by posing as an informed party.
These are the empirical implications that we test after we describe the data we use. There are a number of other implications that are potentially testable that we do not test due to data limitations. For example, there are a number of implications for returns and volume associated with the unconditional probability of manipulation   or the conditional probability of manipulation  . Our data are for actual manipulations so we do not test these. We also have implications for the profitability of manipulation. Data on profitability are less systematically available, so we do not test these. There are also implications for the viability of pooling versus separating that we mentioned in the context of the incentive compatibility constraint. Because we do not observe instances in which manipulation did not occur, we cannot test these implications cross-sectionally. These implications represent avenues for additional research.
3 Empirical Evidence from Manipulation Cases 3.1 Anatomy of Stock Manipulation Cases
To help fix ideas, we provide summaries of two manipulation cases according to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaints filed with U.S. district courts. It is important to note that these cases are not purely trade-based manipulation cases, but also involve the use of rumors, wash sales, and attempts to corner the market. Even though actual cases involve multiple ways of manipulating stock, it is worth noting that our model will still apply in that the welfare, regulatory, and policy implications of these alternative forms of manipulation will be the same as those studied
17

in our manipulation model.
3.1.1 WAMEX Holding Inc.
WAMEX Holdings, Inc. is a New York-based company with its common stock traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.11 The company apparently had plans to operate an electronic trading system for stocks. From December 1999 through June 2000, Mitchell H. Cushing (WAMEX’s CEO), Russell A. Chimenti, Jr. (Chief Administrative O cer), Edward A. Durante (a stock promoter), and several others engaged in a market-manipulation scheme which drove WAMEX’s stock price from $1.375 per share to a high of $22.00 per share.
As part of the scheme, several million WAMEX shares were transferred to Durante-controlled nominee accounts at Union Securities, Ltd., a Canadian brokerage firm. Durante then instructed his broker for these accounts to execute a series of public trades to create artificial price increases in WAMEX stock.
In addition, Cushing, Chimenti and Durante made false public statements through press re- leases, SEC filings, and Internet publications concerning, among other things: approximately $6.9 million in funding that WAMEX had supposedly raised from a private investment group; WAMEX’s ability to legally operate an electronic stock trading system; and the purportedly extensive experi- ence of Cushing and Chimenti in the investment banking industry. The SEC reports that WAMEX had only received a fraction of the financing it had reported, all of which came from fraudulent stock sales. WAMEX had never obtained regulatory approval to operate its electronic stock trading system. Cushing’s and Chimenti’s investment banking experience consisted of their employment at several boiler rooms in the United States and Austria. Cushing neglected to disclose that he faced arrest in Austria as a result of his fraudulent securities activities there.
Durante also entered into a series of block deals. The block deals involved pre-arranged public market purchases of large blocks of WAMEX stock that were sold at a discount. The block deals apparently misled investors into believing that there was a highly liquid market for WAMEX shares and led to artificially inflated prices. The SEC alleges that as a result of this scheme, Durante and the others were able to sell 6.9 million WAMEX shares into the market for profits of over $24 million.
This particular example illustrates several features common to many cases of stock price ma-

nipulation: first, the use of nominee accounts to create artificial volume in a stock; second, the release of false information and rumors; third, the purchase of large blocks of stock to create the impression of information-based trade.
3.1.2 Paravant Computer Systems, Inc.
In June 1996, Duke & Company, a broker-dealer, served as the underwriter for the initial public o ering of common stock of Paravant Computer Systems, Inc. in the Nasdaq market.12 In the IPO, Paravant’s common stock was o ered to the public at $5.00 per share. On June 3, 1996, the IPO was declared e ective and trading commenced in Paravant securities. During the first day of trading, the price of Paravant’s common stock increased to $9.875 per share.
This increase occurred because Duke, which served as a market maker for Paravant securities, along with Victor M. Wang (CEO of Duke) and his associates (Gregg A. Thaler, Charles T. Ben- nett, and Je rey S. Honigman), artificially restricted the supply of Paravant common stock and created significant demand for the common stock. Wang and Thaler allocated a large percentage of the common stock issued in the Paravant IPO to a liated customer accounts on the condition that these customers immediately flip this common stock back to Duke after the commencement of trading following the IPO. This arrangement ensured that Duke had a large supply of Paravant common stock in its inventory. Prior to the IPO, Bennett and Honigman, as well as other Duke representatives, pre-solicited customers to purchase Paravant common stock once aftermarket trad- ing in Paravant securities commenced to ensure demand for the common stock. Thus, as a result of the artificially small supply of common stock and the artificially created demand, once aftermarket trading commenced, the price of Paravant common stock increased.
On June 4, 1996, after the price of Paravant common stock had increased to prices ranging from $10.75 to $13.375 per share, Duke resold the common stock that it had purchased from the a liated customer accounts, as well as stock Duke did not own (thus taking a large short position in the stock), to the retail customers Duke had pre-solicited to purchase common stock. As a result of its manipulative activities in connection with Paravant common stock, Duke generated over $10,000,000 in illegal profits. The manipulation ceased on June 21, 1996.
In this example, the manipulation is quite straightforward. A market maker and underwriter simply uses its privileged position to restrict supply while using its brokerage to generate demand
12The information for this case comes from Securities and Exchange Commission (1999) and Morgenson (1999).
19
 
from retail investors. The market maker is able to sell shares from inventory, thereby profiting at the expense of both the issuer and the retail investors.
3.2 Data Description
To provide more systematic evidence on stock market manipulation, we collect data on stock market manipulation cases pursued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from January 1990 to October 2001. Specifically, we collect all SEC litigation releases that contain the key word “manipulation” and “9(a)” or “10(b)” which refer to the two articles of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. We then manually construct a database of all these manipulation cases. Additional information about the cases are collected from other legal databases such as Lexis-Nexis and the Securities and Exchange Commission Annual Reports. There are 142 cases in total. Table 1 reports data on the distribution of cases by year and by the markets in which the manipulated stocks were traded. There was an increase in manipulation cases in 2000 and 2001, either due to an increase in manipulation activities or intensified enforcement action by the SEC.
For manipulated stocks, we collect daily stock prices, trading volume, and capitalization from January 1989 to December 2001 from the online service Factset. Since about half of the manipulated stocks were traded in over-the-counter markets such as NASD’s OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets, we collect daily price, volume, and capitalization data for all stocks traded on the OTC Bulletin Board from January 1989 to December 2001. We are able to collect some data for 78 stocks, and our empirical tests are designed to use as much of the data as possible. Of the 78 stocks, we have complete data for 51 stocks to conduct our empirical analysis.
Table 2 reports summary statistics for the manipulated stocks. Sample mean, standard devia- tion, skewness and kurtosis coe cients for daily returns and turnover are computed. The results for the manipulation period, the year prior to the manipulation period and the year following the manipulation period are reported in Panels A to C, respectively. Our estimate of volatility is the standard deviation of daily stock returns for the three periods, and the statistics reported are cross- sectional. The mean return during the manipulation period is higher than the mean returns during the pre- and post- manipulation periods. Similarly, the manipulation period returns display the highest standard deviation, positive skewness and kurtosis. Turnover during the manipulation pe- riod is on average higher than that in the pre-manipulation period. During the post-manipulation period, average turnover is still very high. Average volatility during the manipulation period is
20

higher than that during the pre-manipulation period which in turn is higher than that during the post-manipulation period. Finally, we report in Panel D statistics on the length of the manipula- tion period. The median length of manipulation is 202 days. The maximum is 1373 days and the minimum is 2 days.
3.2.1 Manipulators
Our theoretical analysis above shows that a key to successful manipulation is the pooling of the manipulator with the informed party. Hence, the manipulator needs to be able to credibly pose as a potentially informed party. There are many ways to do this. For example, one way to credibly pose as an informed party is to be an insider. Others such as brokers, underwriters, market makers, or large shareholders can also credibly pose as potentially informed investors. Table 3 shows results on the distribution of several types of “potentially informed” parties who were involved in manipulation cases. Corporate insiders such as executives and directors are involved in 47.89% of the manipulation cases. Brokers are involved in 64.08% of the cases. Large shareholders with at least 5% equity ownership are involved in 31.69% of the cases. Market makers and stock underwriters are involved in more than 20% of the manipulation cases. The sum of the percentages across types exceeds 100% because more than one “potentially informed” type can be involved in any given case. Indeed, most manipulation schemes are undertaken jointly by several parties. This evidence suggests that manipulators are close to the information loop and can thus credibly pose as being informed about the future value of stocks.
3.2.2 Manipulation Schemes
Our model of manipulation occurs in a setting where the manipulator inflates the stock price in the absence of good news. Our analysis of manipulation cases shows that inflating the stock price is indeed the most common type of manipulation. Figure 1 displays the breakdown of manipulation types. 84.51% of manipulation cases involve the inflation of stock prices while less than 1% of cases involve the deflation of stock prices. Stabilization accounts for 2%. For about 13% of cases we do not have enough information to classify the type of manipulation.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of ways to profit in manipulation cases. Since not all activities of the manipulators are reported and identified in the cases, the reported percentages are a lower bound for the true percentages. Manipulators often try to create an artificially high price through
21

wash trades and the use of nominee accounts (40.14% of our cases involve such trades). They trade among accounts owned by essentially the same individual or group. We argue that the increased trading volume and price often attract the attention of investors or information seekers. Indeed, for our entire sample of manipulated stocks, the mean daily average turnover during manipulation periods is about 20% higher than that for non-manipulation periods. In these cases, it is plausible that investors believe there is good news about the stock, without realizing that much of the trading activity does not involve any real change in ownership.
Since information seekers constantly search for investment opportunities, manipulators often resort to propagating false information to encourage information seekers to purchase shares. For our entire sample, 55.63% of all cases involve the spread of rumors. Historically, manipulators have colluded with newspaper columnists and stock promoters to spread false information. With the advent of the Internet, chat rooms and message bulletin boards have become popular means to distribute false information. From January 2000 to October 2001, about 39% of all manipulation cases involved the use of the Internet to spread rumors. Figure 2 also shows that in 54.93% of the cases, manipulators buy and then sell stock in the market to realize a profit (as opposed to situations in which they already own the stock). Finally, about 13% of the manipulators tried to corner the supply of stock in order to inflate prices.
3.2.3 Manipulated Markets
As shown above in the model, when there are more information seekers in the market and in the absence of manipulators, information is quickly reflected in the stock price and the market is more e cient. Yet the presence of more information seekers also makes it possible for manipulators to pool with the informed party and profit from trading with the information seekers. Certainly, the more information seekers trade with manipulators, the more they lose. Hence in a market with many manipulators, information seekers make fewer profits so they enter the market less frequently. As a result, market manipulation can drive away information seekers and make the market ine cient. In the extreme, there will be no information seekers and the market is informationally ine cient. With manipulators present in the market, our model predicts that the price at time 2 does not converge to the true value of the stock to be revealed at time 3. Therefore a higher probability of manipulation decreases market e ciency.
Our results in Table 1 show that most manipulation cases occur in markets we think of as being 22

relatively ine cient. For example, 47.89% of all manipulation cases happen in the over-the-counter markets such as the OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets, and 33.81% of the cases happen in either regional exchanges or unidentified markets. About 17% of the cases occur on the NYSE, AMEX, or Nasdaq National Market combined. Overall, the OTC Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets, and the regional exchanges are relatively ine cient in the sense that they are small and illiquid. For example, currently the OTC Bulletin Board provides access to more than 3,800 securities and includes more than 330 participating market makers. Yet the daily average volume is still $100 million to $200 million.13 Our results show that about over 50% of the stocks manipulated are “penny stocks” with very low average trading volume and market capitalization.
The markets in which manipulation is more likely to occur also have the feature that there are much lower disclosure requirements for their listed firms, and the firms are subject to much less stringent securities regulations and rules. For example, OTC Bulletin Board stocks were not required to file annual reports with regulators before June 2000. The new disclosure requirements seem to have driven many OTC Bulletin Board stocks to the Pink Sheets, which require virtually nodisclosureatall.14 Thesearepreciselythemarketswhereasymmetricinformationproblemsare likely to be the most severe. Thus we argue that the lack of disclosure requirements and regulatory oversight allow manipulators to operate with ease. In particular, it will be easier for manipulators
to pool with informed parties. Hence, these markets are likely to be informationally ine cient.
13As of November, 2001, the largest company on the OTCBB was Publix Super Markets with a $9 billion market capitalization and $15 billion in revenues. Heroes, Inc., was the smallest, with a $302,000 market capitalization and revenues of $6.5 million. Some 2,000 OTCBB companies have an average market cap of $1 million or less. Some 42% of all trades are made in the top 100 OTCBB securities. The top 500 stocks account for 74% of the total trading volume, and the top 1,000 stocks account for 88% of the total.
14The SEC and the NASD are in the process of turning the OTC Bulletin Board into a more regulated market place. As part of the transformation, qualifying small issuers will need to meet defined listing standards and pay listing fees. Minimal governance standards will require that companies must have at least 100 shareholders who own at least 100 shares each, and that there be 200,000 shares in the public float. Also, the auditor must be subject to peer review, the company will need to issue an annual report, there will have to be an annual shareholder meeting with proxies and a quorum of at least 1/3rd of the shareholders present in person or by proxy. Listed companies will need at least one independent director and there must be an independent audit committee with a majority of independent directors. Certain transactions will require shareholder approval, and rules will be in e ect to prohibit voting restrictions. Our model predicts that with regulators playing an active role in this market, the OTC Bulletin Board will be subject to the action of fewer manipulators; trading volume will increase, and the market will become more e cient.
23
 
In contrast to the more ine cient markets, the New York Stock Exchange is relatively free from manipulation. Only 2.11% of manipulation cases occur on the NYSE, yet its total market capitalization is much larger than the sum of the market capitalizations of the OTC Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets, the regional exchanges, and the Nasdaq small cap market.
It is interesting to note that not all small and relatively illiquid markets are rife with manipu- lation. From Table 1 we see that the Nasdaq SmallCap Market had only two manipulation cases during our sample. This market has to follow similar disclosure and trading rules as those followed by the Nasdaq National Market. This highlights the importance of regulations and oversight for stock markets, even for small and relatively illiquid ones.
3.3 The Liquidity, Return and Volatility of Manipulated Stocks
We observed above that many manipulated stocks trade in relatively illiquid over-the-counter mar- ket. Does illiquidity in a stock imply a higher likelihood of it being manipulated? This is plausible since one key element to a successful manipulation is to move the price e ectively. It is hard to imagine that any manipulator would be able to move a large capitalization and highly liquid stock such as GE by any significant amount without incurring huge cost and taking on enormous risk. To study this issue, we compute the average daily turnover over the manipulation, pre- and post- manipulation periods. The pre- and post- manipulation periods are the 1-year periods before and after the manipulation period.
For each manipulated stock we also compute the average daily turnover for a benchmark. For the benchmark, we match the manipulated stock to an equally weighted portfolio of 10 randomly se- lected stocks. These stocks must have market capitalizations within 10% of that of the manipulated stock, and they are chosen from all stocks available in the specific market on which the manipu- lated stock trades. For example, for a manipulated OTC Bulletin Board stock, we would randomly choose 10 stocks with similar capitalizations from all available OTC Bulletin Board stocks. We then compute the average daily turnover for the portfolio as the benchmark. We then cross-sectionally regress the average daily turnover on a constant and a dummy for manipulation. The dummy variable equals 1 for the manipulated stock and equals 0 for the benchmark. The sample period is from January 1990 to December 2001:
turnover =  0 +  1   I{manipulated} + e. (31) 24

There are a total 51 manipulated stocks for which we can find trading data. With the matched sample from the benchmark, we have a total of 102 observations in the regressions.
Panel A of Table 4 reports the regression results. For the pre-manipulation period, manipu- lation period and the post-manipulation period, average daily turnover is between 3-4% for the benchmarks. For the pre-manipulation period, the coe cient on the dummy variable is negative and significant, implying that manipulated stocks are less liquid prior to the manipulation than their benchmarks. In the manipulation period and the post-manipulation period, liquidity is higher for the manipulated stocks than the benchmarks.
How did the manipulated stocks perform relative to other stocks during the manipulation pe- riod? Since most manipulations involve inflating stock prices as shown in Figure 1, we expect prices to go up on average in a manipulation. However, for some cases, manipulators drove up the price which subsequently dropped below the pre-manipulation level before the end of manipulative ac- tivities. We show below that the overall e ect is still positive during the manipulation period. We also examine if manipulators prefer stocks that have underperformed or outperformed their market benchmarks. Finally we study the return performance of manipulated stocks after manipulative activities have stopped to see if they systematically underperform.
We compute the average daily returns over the manipulation period, as well as over the pre- and post- manipulation period. As we did for turnover, we compute the average daily returns for the corresponding period for a benchmark, an equally weighted portfolio of 10 similar stocks. We then cross-sectionally regress the average daily return on a constant and a dummy for manipulation. The dummy variable equals 1 for the manipulated stocks and equals 0 for the benchmarks. The sample period is from January 1990 to December 2001:
return =  0 +  1   I{manipulated} + e. (32)
Panel B of Table 4 reports the regression results. For the benchmarks, average daily returns are not significantly di erent from zero for the pre-manipulation period, the manipulation period and the post-manipulation period. For the manipulated stocks, average daily returns are not di erent from the benchmark during the pre-manipulation period. During the manipulation period, however, average daily returns are 2.56% higher than for the benchmarks and this di erence is statistically significant. During the post-manipulation period, average daily returns are lower for manipulated stocks than the benchmarks at -0.13% and are statistically significant. We therefore conclude that manipulated stocks on average experience an increase in the stock price during the manipulation
25

period, and the price subsequently drops during the post-manipulation period. There is no evidence that manipulators prefer either underperforming or outperforming stocks.
We next examine the volatility of manipulated stocks. The results are reported in Panel C of Table 4. The analysis is similar to that on returns above, except now we use standard deviation as the dependent variable in the regression:
volatility =  0 +  1   I{manipulated} + e. (33)
In computing the benchmarks’ volatilities, we average the standard deviation for the 10 stocks in the portfolio. For the pre- and post- manipulation periods, volatility is higher for manipulated stocks, but the coe cients are not statistically significant. The volatility for manipulated stocks is much higher than that for the benchmarks during the manipulation period. This reflects the fact that manipulated stocks often experience dramatic price movements during the manipulation period.
Overall, these results suggest that prior to the manipulation, manipulated stocks are unex- ceptional in terms of returns and volatility. They are less liquid, however, which is oftentimes interpreted as signifying high information asymmetry. During the manipulation period, manipu- lated stocks exhibit higher returns, higher liquidity, and higher volatility. Liquidity and volatility remain higher for manipulated stocks in the post manipulation period, but returns become lower relative to benchmarks. These results are interesting in their own right as they establish some basic facts about stock market manipulation in the U.S. These results are consistent with most models of successful trade-based manipulation, for example, Allen and Gale (1992). As a result, they do not uniquely identify the forces we focus on in our model, namely, the interaction between manipulators and information seekers. In order to provide more direct tests of our model, in the next section we focus on specifications based on changes rather than levels. In this section, we noted that during the manipulation period, volatility, liquidity, and returns are all high. In the next section, we ask whether returns are higher when liquidity is higher and when volatility is higher.
4 Empirical Tests of the Model
In this section we test the empirical implications of our model. There are four periods including time zero in the theoretical model. From our case information we know the beginning and end dates of manipulations. Note that this reported manipulation period corresponds to the sum of
26

time 1, when the manipulator buys, and time 2, when the manipulator sells. Since we do not know exactly when time 1 ends and time 2 begins, we simply break the reported manipulation period into two equal sub-periods, with the first half representing time 1 and the second half representing time 2. We use the one-year period before manipulation as time 0 and the one-year period after manipulation as time 3.
We first test Prediction 1, that the price at time 1 is higher than the price at time 0 (p0 < p 1) and the price at time 2 is higher than the price at time 1 (p 1 < p 2). We estimate the average cumulative return between time 0 and and time 1 (221%), and between time 1 and time 2 (174%), respectively. The test statistics are reported in Table 5. The manipulator’s demand for shares at time 1 raises the price relative to time 0. At time 2, when the manipulator sells, the information seekers are in the market, and their demand exceeds the manipulator’s supply, which is how the manipulator is able to profit. We also test that the price declines after the manipulation period. Contrary to our model, the price p3 is greater than p0. However, we consider this to be a weak test of the model for two reasons. First, the manipulation period di ers quite dramatically across our manipulation cases. Second, p3 is meant to capture the long run in our model, and the one- year post-manipulation period may not be su cient. Further, our test shows that p 2 is greater than p3 (-27% return). This is consistent with our model. The price of the shares falls after the manipulation ends.
There are two things to note about this result. First, this result is consistent with many models of manipulation such as Allen and Gale (1992), not just ours. It is inconsistent, however, with the unraveling problem and with Allen and Gorton (1992). Second, the magnitudes involved are quite large. As noted in Table 2, the median (mean) manipulation period is 202 (308) days. Given that we break this period in half, we calculate that manipulators make returns of 174% in 101 to 154 days.
The above result is shown graphically by plotting the path of manipulated stock prices. Since for di erent manipulated stocks the lengths of the periods can be very di erent, we need to standardize the manipulation periods. We scale the lengths of the manipulation periods such that they are presented over a grid showing di erent stages of the manipulation. For example, 0 represents the beginning of the manipulation period, 0.5 represents the middle and 1 represents the end of the manipulation.15 Cumulativereturnsarecomputedforeachmanipulatedstockfromthebeginningto

the end of the manipulation. Figure 3 shows the average cumulative returns and average turnover for the 51 manipulated stocks for which data are available. The top panel shows the average cumulative return and the bottom panel the average daily turnover over the manipulation period. The cumulative return increases dramatically during the manipulation period with relatively high volatility. At the end of the manipulation period, it declines as discussed above. In the bottom panel of Figure 3, average daily turnover increases throughout the manipulation period, but is quite noisy. While average turnover is higher in the second half (0.1288) than in the first half (0.0667), the di erence is not statistically significant.
We next test Prediction 2 that returns are higher when there are more information seekers. Our model predicts that the amount of trading is increasing in the number of information seekers. We use the overall level of trading activities for a manipulated stock as a measure of the level of presence of information seekers. We classify manipulated stocks into two groups, one with high average turnover in the second period and one with low average turnover during that period. The two groups of stocks are formed based on whether the average turnover for the stock is higher or lower than the median average turnover. We then test if the cumulative return between time 2 and time 1 is significantly higher for the high turnover group than for the low turnover group. The return di erential for the high turnover group relative to the low turnover group is 208%. Similarly we also test if the cumulative return between time 2 and time 0 is significantly higher for the high turnover group than for the low turnover group. The return di erential for the high turnover group relative to the low turnover group is 388%. From Table 6, the t-statistic for the first test equals 1.2545, which is not statistically significant. The second test statistic equals 2.7544, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. Hence there is some evidence supporting Prediction 2.
The above tests can be shown graphically. Figure 4 shows the average cumulative returns for low and high turnover manipulated stocks. Cumulative returns are computed for each manipulated stock from the beginning to the end of the manipulation, and then averaged across stocks. They are presented over a grid showing di erent stages of the manipulation. The di erence between the initial price and the peak price during manipulation reflects the profitability of the manipulator. The figure shows that high turnover stocks on average reach a higher peak price, consistent with the theoretical prediction that returns are increasing in the number of information seekers.
What is interesting about this result is the extent to which volume matters for returns. Con- sistent with the model, a large number of active traders is necessary for high returns to the ma-

nipulator. Importantly, this result is not predicted by Allen and Gale (1992), which does not have cross-sectional predictions for volume. Furthermore, in the more general market microstructure literature, the evidence on the relation between volume and the direction of the returns is mixed (See Lee and Swaminathan 2000). Thus, this finding is an important result in understanding manipulation.
Finally, we test Prediction 3 that returns are increasing in the dispersion in the value of the stock. We sort manipulated stocks by their average daily volatility over the manipulation period, and form two groups of stocks based on whether the average volatility for the stock is higher or lower than the median average volatility. We then estimate the di erence in average cumulative returns between these groups, and test for its statistical significance. The last two rows of Table 6 show that both t-statistics are positive, and the test for (p 2   p0) is significant. The greater is the dispersion in the stock value, the greater the returns to the manipulator.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we extend the framework of Allen and Gale (1992) and study what happens when a manipulator can trade in the presence of other traders who seek out information about the stock’s true value. These information seekers or arbitrageurs play a vital role in sustaining manipulation. Because information seekers buy on information, they are the ones who are manipulated. In a market without manipulators, these information seekers unambiguously improve market e ciency by pushing prices up to the level indicated by the informed party’s information. In a market with manipulators,theinformationseekersplayamoreambiguousrole. Moreinformationseekersimply greater competition for shares, improving market e ciency, but also increasing the possibility for the manipulator to enter the market. This worsens market e ciency from the perspective of price transparency. This suggests a strong role for government regulation to discourage manipulation while encouraging greater competition for information.
Using a unique dataset, we then provide evidence from SEC actions in cases of stock manipu- lation. We find that potentially informed parties such as corporate insiders, brokers, underwriters, large shareholders and market makers are likely to be manipulators. More illiquid stocks are more likely to be manipulated and manipulation increases stock volatility. We show that stock prices rise throughout the manipulation period and then fall in the post-manipulation period. Prices and
29

liquidity are higher when the manipulator sells than when the manipulator buys. In addition, at the time the manipulator sells, prices are higher when liquidity is greater, consistent with returns to manipulation being higher when there are more information seekers in the market. Also, at the time the manipulator sells, prices are higher when volatility is greater, consistent with returns to manipulation being higher when there is greater dispersion in the market’s estimate of the value of thestock. Theseresultsareconsistentwiththemodelandsuggestthatstockmarketmanipulation may have important impacts on market e ciency.
Our results are relevant not just for cases of stock market manipulation but also for cases of securities fraud generally. For example, cases of accounting and earnings manipulation such as Enron and Worldcom also fit within our model. To the extent that these were companies closely followed by information seekers, they were more susceptible to manipulation by insiders. On the empirical side, we have just scratched the surface of what is known about cases of stock market manipulation and there are many empirical implications of our model left to be tested.

Appendix A
Here we consider the case in which there is an informed party and information seekers but no manipulator present. We present, for completeness, an alternative equilibrium to the one in the text. In this equilibrium, the informed party buys at both time 1 and time 2 and the information seekers buy at time 2. At time 2, the price of shares as a function of the demand for shares by both the informed and the information seekers is represented by:
p2 =a+b(q1I +q2I +XqAi). (34) 2
i N The information seekers choose their demand according to:
max VHqAi  (a+b(q1I +q2I +XqAi))qAi. (35) qAi2 22
2 i N The informed chooses her demand according to:
max VHq2I  (a+b(q1I +q2I +XqAi))q2I. (36) q2I 2
i N
Taking the first order conditions of the information seekers and the informed party, imposing
symmetry on the information seekers, and solving yields:
V H   a + k   b q 1I (N + 2)b .
V H   k   a   k N   b q 1I (N+2)b

(37) . (38)
 q2 = At time 1, the informed party solves:
 q1I  (a+b(qI +qI + qAi))qI. 1 2 i N2 2
Taking the first order condition and solving yields the following choices of quantities for both the informed party and the information seekers:
qI  = VH  k a VH  k a 2kN (40) 1 2b 2b(3+N2 +4N)
qI  = (N+2)(VH k a 2kN) (41)

qAi  2
=
2b(3+N2 +4N)
(N +2)(VH  a+k)+2k(N +1). (42)
2b(3+N2 +4N) 31
 
As a result of these quantity choices, we can derive equilibrium prices at time 1 and time 2 as well as profits for the information seekers:
p 1 = VH k+a VH k a 2kN (43) 2 2(3+N2 +4N)
2a+aN +7VHN +4VH  3kN  4k+2VHN2
2(3+N2+4N) (44)
   
p2 =
  
Ai 
1(aN  VHN  3kN +2a 2VH  4k)2
= 4 (3+N2+4N)2b . (45)
 The equilibrium profits for the informed party is a long and complicated expression which we do not reproduce here. It is also not particularly revealing for our purposes. In order to see that the informed party will not deviate from the equilibrium of purchasing shares in both periods, we need only show that the time 2 price is less than the value the informed party gets from holding shares until time 3, VH   k. In this case, the informed party cannot do better by selling shares at time 2. This condition is:
V H   k   p  2 = ( N + 2 ) ( V H   k   a )   2 k N 2   4 k N > 0 . ( 4 6 ) 2(3+N2 +4N)
The key point that emerges from this condition is that as long as k is small or N is small, the expression will be positive and the informed party will prefer to purchase shares in both periods.
Appendix B
In the separating equilibrium, the informed party purchases shares in both periods. The manipulator will choose not to enter the market. In order to see why and under what conditions such an equilibrium can exist, we use the analysis of the equilibrium from Appendix A. Recall that in that equilibrium, the informed party purchases shares at time 1 and then purchases additional shares at time 2. The information seekers, observing the prices and quantities purchased at time 1, infer that the informed party is buying shares and also purchase shares at time 2.
Nowsupposethatthemanipulatormayalsopurchasesharesattime1. Clearly,themanipulator will want to sell these shares at time 2, since the manipulator knows the value of the shares at time 3 is VL. The manipulator must purchase the same quantity of shares at time 1 as the informed party, q1M = q1I = q1, because otherwise the information seekers will infer that the purchaser is the manipulator and they will buy no shares at time 2. This quantity from Appendix A is:
q1 = VH   k   a   VH   k   a   2kN . (47) 2b 2b(3+N2 +4N)
32
   
The price at which these shares are bought is:
p  1 = V H   k + a   V H   k   a   2 k N . ( 4 8 ) 2 2(3+N2 +4N)
What do the information seekers infer from observing a purchase of shares q1 at time 1? We claim that the information seekers’ beliefs are that the purchaser of the shares at time 1 is the informed party with probability 1. To see this, take the information seekers’ beliefs as correct. In this case, from Appendix A, the N information seekers each demand
qAi  = (N +2)(VH  a+k)+2k(N +1) (49) 2 2b(3+N2 +4N)
shares at time 2. As the manipulator is not holding his shares or buying additional shares, but instead selling his q1 shares, the price at time 2 is determined by the information seekers’ demands:
p2 = a+b(XqAi ) (50) 2
   i N
6a+aN2 +6aN +2NVH +4kN +N2VH +3kN2
= 2(3+N2 +4N) . (51) For k or N small enough, p2 will be less than p1, implying that the manipulator loses money on
 every share bought. To see this, note that:
p1  p2 = VH  k a 2kN. (52)
N+3
As a result, the manipulator will not enter the market for k or N small enough, and the beliefs we ascribed to the information seekers are, in fact, correct.
We have focused on two equilibria—a pooling equilibrium and a separating equilibrium. There are potentially many other equilibria as well that we have not studied. In particular, we have associatedtheseparatingequilibriumwithlowvaluesoftwoparameters: thenumberofinformation seekers N and the cost of holding shares for the informed party k. We have associated the pooling equilibrium with high values of these two parameters. In between high and low values for these parameters exists a range of values for which other equilibria are possible.
We focus on the pooling and separating equilibria because they exhibit the basic forces we wish to study. In the separating equilibrium, manipulation is not possible. This is governed by two factors. First, in order for manipulation to be sustainable, it must be the case that the informed partywishestosellhersharesbeforethefundamentalvalueisrealized. Ifsheissu cientlypatient,
33
 
then a manipulator will not be able to mimic her strategy. Second, if there are a small number of information seekers, then the best the informed party can do is to hold shares until the fundamental value is realized. In this sense, the information seekers provide a benefit to the informed party. If there are enough information seekers, they will push the time 2 price up to a level at which the informed party is willing to sell rather than incur the cost of waiting until time 3. Up until this point, the information seekers provide the usual service of arbitrage—they incorporate information into the market price and improve the e ciency of market prices.

We study the trading of individual investors using transaction data and identifying buyer- or seller-initiated trades. We document four results: (1) Small trade order imbalance correlates well with order imbalance based on trades from retail brokers. (2) Individual investors herd. (3) When measured annually, small trade order imbalance forecasts future returns; stocks heavily bought underperform stocks heavily sold by 4.4 percentage points the following year. (4) Over a weekly horizon, small trade order imbalance reliably predicts returns, but in the opposite direction; stocks heavily bought one week earn strong returns the subsequent week, while stocks heavily sold earn poor returns. (JEL G11, G12, G14)
A central question in the debate over market efficiency is whether investor sentiment influences asset prices. Shleifer and Summers (1990)1 argue that the demand of some investors “is affected by sentiments not fully justified by fundamental news” and trading by fully rational investors is risky and therefore limited. Thus investor sentiment, as reflected in the retail investor demand, may cause prices to deviate from underlying fundamentals.2 Our research is motivated by this theory of investor sentiment, though we do notclaim to definitively test thetheory.

We analyze tick-by-tick transaction level data for US stock markets using the Trade and Quotes (TAQ) and Institute for the Study of Security Markets (ISSM) transaction data over the period 1983–2001. We document four results: (1) Order imbalance based on buyer- and seller-initiated small trades from the TAQ/ISSM data correlate well with the order imbalance based on trades of individual investors from brokerage firm data. This indicates that small trades that have been signed using algorithms developed by Lee and Ready (1991) are reasonable proxies for the trades of individual investors. (2) Order imbalance based on TAQ/ISSM data indicates strong herding by individual investors. Individual investors predominantly buy (sell) the same stocks as each other contemporaneously. Furthermore, they predominantly buy (or sell) the same stocks one week (or month) as they did the previous week (or month). (3) Stocks heavily bought by individual investors one week (i.e., stocks for which most small trades that week are buyer initiated) earn strong returns contem- poraneously and in the subsequent week, while stocks heavily sold one week earn poor returns contemporaneously and in the subsequent week. This pattern persists for a total of three to four weeks and then reverses for the subsequent several weeks. (4) When measured over one year, small capitalization stocks bought by retail investors have positive contemporaneous returns while medium and large stocks have negative contemporaneous returns. For small, medium, and large stocks the imbalance between purchases and sales of retail investors one year forecasts cross-sectional stock returns the subsequent year. Stocks heavily bought by individuals one year underperform stocks heavily sold by 4.4 percentage points in the following year. Among stocks for which it is most difficult to arbitrage mispricings, the spread in returns between stocks bought and stocks sold is 13.1 percentage points the following year; for stocks with higher levels of individual investor trading, the spread is 13.5 percentage points the following year.
In addition to examining the ability of small trades to forecast returns, we also look at the predictive value of large trades. In striking contrast to our small trade results, stocks heavily purchased with large trades one week earn poor returns in the subsequent week, while stocks heavily sold one week earn strong returns in the subsequent week. When measured over one year, the imbalance between purchases and sales for large trades has little or no predictive power.
We calculate the percentage of small trades that are buyer initiated. This measure of individual investor trading has distinct advantages over alternative measures as a gauge of investor sentiment. Many recent studies analyze propri- etary brokerage account data. Unlike our transactional data, brokerage account records allow researchers to definitively identify trades as retail. However, many retail account databases do not distinguish between executed market and limit orders. We believe that market orders are a better measure of investor sentiment than limit orders because whether or not a limit order is executed depends upon the activities of others. Suppose, for example, that in a particular week, indi- vidual investors place an equal number of buy and sell limit orders for a stock,

Do Retail Trades Move Markets?
but institutional investors only execute against the buy orders. The heavy-buy imbalance of executed individual investor limit orders and the resulting change in investor holdings would, in this case, reflect the beliefs and preferences of the institutions not individuals. Changes in holdings do not provide the infor- mation we need about who initiates the trades leading to holdings changes. Furthermore, our transactional data allows us to look at a much longer time period than we could analyze with existing individual account level databases.
Previous papers have also analyzed quarterly institutional holdings data such as mutual fund holdings (e.g., Grinblatt and Titman, 1989; and Wermers, 1999) and 13F filings data (e.g., Gompers and Mettrick, 2001). If the holdings of in- dividual investors are the complement to institutional holdings, one might ask what advantages our data have over institutional holdings data. There are sev- eral reasons why our data are better suited to test investor sentiment theories of finance than are quarterly institutional holdings. (1) We are interested in the in- fluence of small investor-initiated trades on subsequent cross-sectional returns. Investor holdings can change as a result of both aggressive trades (e.g., market orders) and passive trades (e.g., limit orders). As discussed above, we believe that the distinction between executed market and limit orders is important when measuring investor sentiment. (2) The holdings of investors who place small trades are not the simple complement of reported institutional holdings. Small institutions and wealthy individuals do not file 13Fs. Wolff (2004) reports that over one-third of stock ownership—including direct ownership of shares and indirect ownership through mutual funds, trusts, and retirement accounts—of US households is concentrated in the wealthiest 1% of households. Thus, a large portion of non-institutional holdings are owned by extremely wealthy individuals who may not file 13Fs and whose trading is not likely to be driven by the same considerations that motivate the small traders who interest us. (3) Our methodology enables us to examine the relationship between investor trad- ing and subsequent returns over short horizons such as a week. Short horizons cannot be studied with quarterly data.3
The rest of our paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses re- lated theoretical and empirical work. Section 2 describes our data and empirical methods. Section 3 examines evidence that our measure of the proportion of small trades in each stock that are buyer initiated is highly correlated with the buy-sell imbalance of investors at a large discount brokerage and large retail brokerage. Furthermore, the proportion of small trades in each stock that are buyer initiated is highly persistent over time. Section 4 presents our principal results demonstrating that the proportion of small trades that are buyer initiated predicts future cross-sectional returns at weekly and annual horizons. Section 5 discusses an alternative explanation for our results and Section 6 concludes.
3 One additional disadvantage of 13F data pointed out by Hvidkjaer (2006) is that it does not include institutional short positions. Thus, if a hedge fund enters into a short position through trades with only institutional investors, this will increase institutional holdings as reported on 13F forms, while if a hedge fund enters into a short position through trades with only individual investors, this will not affect institutional holdings as reported on 13F forms.

1. Theory and Prior Evidence
Investor sentiment is generally attributed to individual, retail investors (e.g., Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler, 1991). Since individual investors tend to place small trades, their purchases and sales must be correlated if they are to appreciably affect prices. Barber, Odean, and Zhu (forthcoming) show that the trading of individual investors at a large discount brokerage (1991–1996) and at a large retail brokerage (1997–1999) is systematically correlated.4 In any month, the investors at these brokerages tend to buy and sell the same stocks. Further- more, the monthly imbalance of purchases and sales by these investors [i.e., (purchases − sales)/(purchases + sales)] is correlated over time. Thus, investors are likely to be net buyers (or net sellers) of the same stocks in subsequent months as they are in the current month. Analyzing Australian data for the period 1991–2002, Jackson (2003) also provides evidence that the trading of individual investors is coordinated. We extend these studies by showing that the imbalance of buyer- and seller-initiated small trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and NASDAQ are highly correlated with the imbalance of purchases and sales by individual investors at the two brokerages. Establishing that small trades are a reasonable proxy for the trading of individual investors allows us to use eighteen years of trades’ data to test individual investor herding and to test the effect of this herding on subsequent stock returns.
Other studies have examined the relationship between aggregate individual investor buying and contemporaneous returns. Over a two-year period, Goetzmann and Massa (2003) establish a strong contemporaneous correlation between daily index fund inflows and S&P 500 market returns. Kumar and Lee (2006) demonstrate a correlation in the aggregate buy-sell imbalance of individual investors at a large discount brokerage; these investors tend to move money into or out of the market at the same times as each other. Kumar and Lee find that the buy-sell imbalance of individual investors aggregated for all stocks is related to contemporaneous stock returns, especially for stocks potentially difficult to arbitrage.
Our paper differs from these papers in two important ways. First, we test the implications of persistent buying (or selling) by individuals for subsequent,
4 Many recent papers argue that individual investor trading is often motivated by a variety of psychological heuristics and biases. A combination of mental accounting (Thaler, 1985) and risk seeking in the domain of losses (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) may lead investors to hold onto losing investments and sell winners (see Shefrin and Statman, 1985; Odean, 1998a; Weber and Camerer, 1998; Heath, Huddart, and Lang, 1999; Genesove and Mayer, 2001; Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2001; and Dhar and Zhu, 2006). The representativeness heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) may lead investors to buy securities with strong recent returns (see DeBondt and Thaler, 1987; DeLong et al., 1990b; DeBondt, 1993; and Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998). Overconfidence may cause investors to trade too aggressively and, in combination with self-attribution bias, could contribute to momentum in stock returns (see Kyle and Wang, 1997; Odean, 1998b; Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 1998, 2001; and Gervais and Odean, 2001). Limited attention may constrain the set of stocks investors consider buying (Barber and Odean, forthcoming) thus concentrating purchases in attention grabbing stocks. And anticipated regret may dissuade investors from purchasing stocks that have risen since they were previously sold or purchased (Odean, Strahilevitz, and Barber, 2004).

rather than contemporaneous, cross-sectional returns. Second, we analyze a much longer and broader sample than that used in prior research. The pa- pers that come closest to ours are Jackson (2003); Dorn, Huberman, and Sengmueller (forthcoming); Hvidkjaer (forthcoming); and Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming).
In contemporaneous work, Hvidkjaer (forthcoming),5 like us, uses TAQ and ISSM data to identify buyer- and seller-initiated small trades. He measures the difference in turnover rates for buyer- and seller-initiated small trades over periods of one to twenty-four months. He then analyzes the relationship between signed small trade turnover and subsequent cross-sectional returns. Like us, Hvidkjaer finds that when the small trade imbalances are calculated over a year (as well as shorter and longer periods), stocks most actively purchased (sold) by individual investors underperform in the following year. Hvidkjaer detects evidence of continued underperformance for up to three years. In addition to demonstrating that stocks heavily bought (sold) by individual investors one year earn negative abnormal returns the following year, we also examine the ability of individual investor trades over shorter periods to forecast cross-sectional returns.6
Jackson (2003) examines Australian brokerage trading records from 1991 through 2001 and finds that net buying is persistent from one week to the next and that net buying one week is followed by positive returns the following week.
Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming) look at short horizon returns subse- quent to net buying by individual investors for 1,920 NYSE stocks from 2000 through 2003. They find that stocks heavily bought by individuals one week reliably outperform the market the following week. Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming) propose that risk-averse individual investors provide liquidity to institutions that demand immediacy. Thus prices fall as institutions sell to individuals one week and rebound the next.
While Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming) and we examine measures of individual investor buying intensity, the data measured differ in key respects. (1) Kaniel, Saar, and Titman examine only trades directed to the NYSE. Discount brokerages catering to self-directed individual investors send few, if any, trades to the NYSE.7 Thus, these authors see very few trades from discount or deep discount brokerages. We look at all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ trades; thus our trading measure includes trades by self-directed individuals. (2) Kaniel, Saar, and Titman’s measure includes executed limit orders. Our measure is designed to exclude limit orders. (3) Kaniel, Saar, and Titman look only at

NYSE listed stocks. We include AMEX and NASDAQ stocks. Thus, we look at many more small firms than do Kaniel, Saar, and Titman’s (forthcoming) and, as discussed in Section 4, we find substantially different return patterns for large and small firms.
Our empirical findings also differ from those of Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming) in critical ways. First, our buying intensity measure is positively correlated with weekly contemporaneous returns—what one expects from mar- ket orders. Kaniel, Saar, and Titman’s buying intensity measure is negatively correlated with daily and weekly contemporaneous returns—what one expects from limit orders. Second, our weekly buying intensity measure is positively correlated with returns over the following two weeks and negatively correlated with returns at the fifth week and beyond. This is consistent with the investor sentiment theory that we test. Kaniel, Saar, and Titman’s buying intensity mea- sure is also correlated with the following week’s return; however, they do not report the same reversal that we find at the fifth week nor does their story predict such a reversal.
Dorn, Huberman, and Sengmueller (forthcoming) examine trading records for 37,000 investors with accounts at a German discount brokerage. They doc- ument correlated trading by these investors at daily, weekly, monthly, and quar- terly horizons. Weekly net limit order purchases correlate negatively with con- temporaneous returns and positively with returns the following week. Weekly net market order purchases correlate positively with contemporaneous returns and positively with returns the following week.
Andrade, Chang, and Seasholes (2006) examine changes in margin holdings by investors—primarily individual investors—on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. They find that weekly changes in (long) margin holdings correlate positively with contemporaneous returns and negatively with returns over the subsequent ten weeks.
Unlike Jackson (2003); Andrade, Chang, and Seasholes (2006); Dorn, Huberman, and Sengmueller (forthcoming); and Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming), we also look at the predictive value of large trades. In striking contrast to our small trade results, we find that stocks predominantly purchased with large trades one week underperform those predominantly sold that week during the following week. Finally, with the luxury of a longer time series of data, we are able to analyze the effect of persistent buying (or selling) over a longer annual horizon. In contrast to weekly results, we document that when the percentage of trades that are buyer initiated is calculated over an annual horizon stocks underperform, rather than outperform, subsequent to individual investor net buying.8
Previous studies demonstrate that individual investors lose money through trading. Odean (1999) and Barber and Odean (2001) report that the stocks that

individual investors purchase underperform the stocks they sell.9 Examining all orders and trades over five years by all individual and institutional investors in Taiwan, Barber et al. (forthcoming) find that individual investors lose money through trade before subtracting costs, and that these losses result primarily from aggressive (i.e., liquidity demanding) trades. While the losses of indi- vidual investors suggest that their trades might have predictive value, previous studies shed little light on the degree to which these trades will forecast cross- sectional differences in stock returns. Furthermore, the brokerage data analyzed by Odean (1999) and Barber and Odean (2001) identify purchases and sales, but (importantly) does not indicate whether trades were initiated by the buyer or seller. Thus, some of the losses of investors documented in previous studies could arise from the limit orders of individual investors being opportunistically picked off by institutional investors.
The principal finding of our study is that, measured over both long and short horizons, the imbalance of small buyer- and seller-initiated trade forecasts subsequent cross-sectional differences in stock returns.
2. Data and Methods
Our empirical analyses rely on the combination of tick-by-tick transaction data compiled by the Institute for the Study of Securities Market (ISSM) for the period 1983–1992 and the NYSE from 1993 to 2000. The latter database is commonly referred to as the Trade and Quote (TAQ) database. Together, these databases provide a continuous history of transactions on the NYSE and AMEX from 1983 to 1992. NASDAQ data are available from 1987 to 2000, though NASDAQ data are unavailable in 6 months during this period.10 We end our analysis in 2000, since the widespread introduction of decimalization in 2001, together with growing use of computerized trading algorithms to break up institutional trades, created a profound shift in the distribution of trade size and likely undermines our ability to identify trades initiated by individuals or institutions.
We identify each trade in these databases as buyer or seller initiated following the procedure outlined in Lee and Ready (1991). Specifically, trades are identified as buyer or seller initiated using a quote rule and a tick rule. The quote rule identifies trades as buyer initiated if the trade price is above the
9 Some individual investors may have more stock-picking skill than their peers. Coval, Hirshleifer, and Shumway (2005) find that some individual investors earn reliably positive returns, at least before trading costs. Ivkovich and Weisbenner (2005) argue individual investors profit on investments close to their home, although Seasholes and Zhu (2005) argue that these effects are not robust. Ivkovich, Sialm, and Weisbenner (forthcoming) document that individual investors with concentrated portfolios earn strong returns. Barber et al. (2005) find that the most active day traders in Taiwan earn positive profits before costs and that 3% of day traders who were most profitable in the previous 6 months are reliably profitable in the following month even after costs.
10 NASDAQ data are missing in April and May 1987, April and July 1988, and November and December 1989. In addition to these months, there are additional 46 trading days with no data for NASDAQ stocks between 1987 and 1991. There are also 146 trading days with no data for NYSE/AMEX between 1983 and 1991. We use data posted on the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) as of August 2005.

midpoint of the most recent bid-ask quote and seller initiated if the trade price is below the midpoint. The tick rule identifies a trade as buyer initiated if the trade price is above the last executed trade price and seller initiated if the trade price is below the last executed trade price.
NYSE/AMEX and NASDAQ stocks are handled slightly differently. First, since the NYSE/AMEX opens with a call auction that aggregates orders, open- ing trades on these exchanges are excluded from our analysis; the call auction on open is not a feature of the NASDAQ, so its opening trades are included. Second, Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara (2000) document that the tick rule is su- perior to the quote rule for NASDAQ trades that execute between the posted bid and ask prices. Thus, we follow their recommendation and use the quote rule for trades that execute at or outside the posted quote and use the tick rule for all other trades that execute within the bid and ask prices. In contrast, for NYSE/AMEX stocks, we use the tick rule only for trades that execute at the midpoint of the posted bid and ask price.
In addition to signing trades (i.e., identifying whether a trade is buyer or seller initiated), we use trade size as a proxy for individual investor and institutional trades as outlined by Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) and partition trades into five bins based on trade size (T):
1. T ≤ $5,000 (small trades)
2. $5,000 < T ≤ $10,000
3. $10,000 < T ≤ $20,000
4. $20,000 < T ≤ $50,000
5. $50,000 < T (large trades).
Trades less than $5,000 (small trades) are used as a proxy for individual investor trades, while trades greater than $50,000 (large trades) are used as a proxy for institutional trades. Lee and Radhakrishna trace signed trades to orders for 144 NYSE stocks over a three-month period in 1990–1991 and document that these trade size bins perform well in identifying trades initiated by individual investors and institutions. To account for changes in purchasing power over time, trade size bins are based on 1991 real dollars and adjusted using the Consumer Price Index.
In each week (month or year), from January 1983 to December 2000, we calculate the proportion of signed trades for a stock that is buyer initiated during the week (month or year) within each trade size bin. All proportions are weighted by value of trade, though results are similar using the number of trades. In each week (month or year), we limit our analysis to stocks with a minimum of ten signed trades within a trade size bin. It is perhaps worth noting that while, on a dollar-weighted basis, there must be a purchase for every sale, no such adding up constraint exists for buyer and seller-initiated trades. In any given period, buyers (or sellers) can initiate the majority of trades.

Do Retail Trades Move Markets?
3. Preliminary Analyses
3.1 Do small trades proxy for individual investor trades?
Several recent empirical studies rely on the assumption that trade size is an effective proxy for identifying the trades of individual investors (e.g., Shan- thikumar, 2003; Hvidkjaer, 2006, forthcoming; Malmendier and Shanthikumar, 2007; and Shanthikumar, 2005). To date, the only empirical evidence validating this claim is provided by Lee and Radhakrishna (2000), who analyze a limited sample of 144 NYSE stocks over a three-month period in 1990–1991. We externally validate the use of trade size combined with the signing algorithms developed by Lee and Ready (1991) as a proxy for the trading of individual investors over a much wider sample of stocks and a longer time period.
To test the effectiveness of using signed small trades as a proxy for individual investor trading, we compare the trading patterns for small signed trades in TAQ/ISSM database to trades of individual investors at a large discount broker in the early 1990s and a large retail (i.e., full service) broker in the late 1990s. The large discount broker data contain approximately 1.9 million common stock trades by 78,000 households between January 1991 and November 1996; these data are described extensively in Barber and Odean (2000). The large retail broker data contain approximately 7.2 million common stock trades by over 650,000 investors between January 1997 and June 1999; these data are described extensively in Barber and Odean (2004).
For each of the three trade datasets, we calculate monthly proportion buys for each stock as described above. For each month from January 1991 through November 1996, we calculate the cross-sectional Spearman rank correlations between the proportion buys for the large discount broker and the proportion buys for each of the five trade size bins in the TAQ/ISSM data. For each month from January 1997 through June 1999, we calculate the correlations between the large retail broker and the TAQ/ISSM data. These mean monthly correlations are presented in Table 1.
The pattern of correlations presented in Table 1, panels A and B, provides strong support for the use of small trades as a proxy for individual investor trading. The correlation in proportion buys is greatest for the two smallest trade size bins and gradually declines. In addition, the correlation between trades by individual investors at both the large retail and discount brokers and the TAQ/ISSM large trades are reliably negative. Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) document that large trades are almost exclusively institutional trades. The correlations presented in Table 1, panels A and B, indicate that the trading patterns of individual investors and institutions are quite different.
In Table 1, panel C, we present the correlation matrix for the monthly pro- portion buys for each of the five trade size bins using data from the TAQ/ISSM datasets. Consistent with the results in panels A and B, the mean correlation between the proportion buys based on small trades and the proportion buys

The table presents the mean monthly percentage Spearman correlation between the proportion buys for TAQ/ISSM trades size bins and the proportion of buys for trades at a large discount broker (panel A) and a large retail broker (panel B) and correlations between the proportions buys for TAQ/ISSM trades size bins (panel C). The standard deviations and t-statistics are based on the monthly time series of cross-sectional correlations.
In each month, we calculate the proportion of trades for a stock that are buys using three datasets: TAQ/ISSM, trades at a large discount broker (January 1991–November 1996), and trades at a large retail broker (January 1997–June 1999). For the TAQ/ISSM data, the proportion of buys is based on trades identified as buyer or seller initiated within five trade size bins. Small trades are less than $5,000 and large trades are greater than $50,000 (in 1991 dollars).
based on large trades is negative, while the correlation of the proportion buys for adjacent trade size bins is uniformly positive.
3.2 Are the trades of individual investors coordinated?
Barber, Odean, and Zhu (forthcoming) document strong correlations in individ- ual investor buying and selling activity within a month and over time; investors at the discount and retail brokerages described above tend to buy (and to sell) the same stocks as each other in the same month and in consecutive months; the same is true for investors at the large retail brokerage. Using the same large discount brokerage data, Kumar and Lee (2006) document that investors’ movements in and out of the market are also correlated. Kumar and Lee tie these movements to contemporaneous small stock returns.
In this section, we use small trades from TAQ/ISSM to confirm that the trading of individual investors is systematically correlated. We conduct two analyses to verify this.

small (or large) trades in stock i during month t that are purchases (i.e., buyer initiated). E[pit] is the proportion of all trades that are purchases in month t. The herding measure essentially tests whether the observed distribution of pit is fat tailed relative to the expected distribution under the null hypothesis that trading decisions are independent and conditional on the overall observed level of buying (E[pit]). Specifically, the herding measure for stock i in month t is calculated as
HMi,t =|pi,t −E[pi,t]|−E|pi,t −E[pi,t]|. (1)
The latter term in this measure, E|pi,t − E[pi,t]| accounts for the fact that we expect to observe more variation in the proportion of buys in stocks with few trades (see Lakonishok et al., 1992, for details). If small trades are independent, the herding measure will have a mean of zero.
We calculate the mean herding measure in each month from January 1983 through December 2000 for both large and small trades. For small trades, the mean herding measure is 7% and is positive in 214 out of 216 months. This measure of herding is in the same ballpark as the monthly herding measures of 6.8% to 12.8% estimated for individual investors by Barber, Odean, and Zhu (forthcoming). For large trades, the mean herding measure we estimate is 10% and is positive in 196 out of 216 months. Wermers (1999) uses quarterly mutual fund holding data to calculate quarterly herding measures ranging from a low of 1.9% to a high of 3.4%. Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992) use quarterly pension fund holdings data to calculate a quarterly herding measure of 2.7% for the pension funds that they analyze. Thus, our estimate of institutional herding is three times that of previous studies. There are three possible reasons why our estimates of institutional herding are larger than previous estimates. First, we are analyzing herding at a monthly horizon rather than a quarterly horizon. Second, we are analyzing only the initiator of the trade. Third, we are estimating herding for only the largest trade size bin. Institutions that rely on large trades may herd more than all institutions in aggregate. For both large and small trades, we find evidence of coordinated trading within the month.
In our second analysis, we analyze the evolution of proportion buys over time by ranking stocks into deciles based on the proportion buys in week t. We then analyze the mean proportion of trades that are buys in the subsequent 104 weeks for each of the deciles. If buying and selling is random, we would expect no persistence in the proportion buys across deciles. (Results are qualitatively similar if we form deciles each month rather than each week.)
In Figure 1, we present the week-to-week evolution of the proportion of buyer-initiated trades for deciles sorted on the proportion of buyer-initiated trades for small trades and large trades. The figure makes clear that there is strong persistence in the direction of trading based on small trades. In the ranking week, the spread in the proportion buys between the top and bottom decile is 58.1 percentage points for small trades and 55.9 percentage points

Figure 1
The evolution of the proportion of buyer-initiated trades over time for small and large trades
Stocks are sorted into deciles based on the proportion of signed trades that are buys in week 0. The figure traces the evolution of the proportion buyer-initiated trades for each decile over the subsequent 104 weeks. Small trades are less than $5,000 and large trades are greater than $50,000 (in 1991 dollars).
for large trades. This spread declines slowly for small trades to 23.0, 16.9, 13.7, and 10.4 after 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks (respectively). In contrast, the spread narrows relatively quickly for large trades to 8.1, 4.7, 3.4, and 2.8 percentage points after 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks, respectively. This evidence suggests that the

trading preferences of individual investors are more persistent than those of institutions.11
4. Does Coordinated Trading Predict Returns?
4.1 Portfolio information and descriptive statistics
The evidence to this point indicates that the preferences of individual investors are coordinated and remarkably persistent. We now turn to the focus of our inquiry: Does this coordinated trading affect prices? Specifically, we are in- terested in learning whether the coordinated buying (selling) of individual investors can support prices above (below) levels that would otherwise be jus- tified by the stock fundamentals, thus forecasting subsequent returns. In short, do individual investor preferences influence prices?
To test this hypothesis, we focus first on annual horizons and begin with a very simple approach. In December of each year from 1983 through 2000, we partition stocks into quintiles based on the proportion of signed small trades that are buyer initiated during the year. Using the monthly Center for Research in Security Pricing (CRSP) database, we construct monthly time series of returns on value-weighted and equally weighted portfolios of stocks in each quintile. Each stock position is held for 12 months following the ranking year (i.e., portfolios are reconstituted in December of each year). We construct analogous portfolios using the proportion of buyer-initiated trades based on large trades.
Table 2 present descriptive statistics for the quintiles based on small trades (panel A) and large trades (panel B). For quintiles based on the propor- tion of buyer-initiated trades calculated using small trades, stocks bought are larger (mean market cap $1.5 billion) and more heavily traded (mean volume $1.6 billion) than stocks sold (mean market cap of $500 million and mean volume of $368 million). Among stocks predominantly sold, small trades rep- resent a larger proportion of all trades by both value and number. Similar patterns emerge for quintiles based on the proportion of buyer-initiated trades calculated using large trades. For all quintiles, small trades represent a high proportion of the total number of trades, while large trades represent a high proportion of the total value of trade.
During the ranking year, with one exception, stocks heavily sold by both individual and institutional investors earn poor returns while stocks heavily bought earn strong returns. This is not at all surprising, since our convention for identifying trades as buyer or seller initiated conditions on price moves. Trades that move prices up are considered buyer initiated, while those that move prices down are seller initiated. The one exception to this pattern is the value-weighted portfolios based on small trades.
11 We observe buyer- and seller-initiated trades, not actual preferences. In response to a change in preference for some stocks, institutions, as a group, may simply execute their trades more quickly than individuals even though their preferences are no less persistent than those of individuals.

Quintiles are formed on the basis of annual proportion buyer-initiated transactions for small trades (panel A) and large trades (panel B) from 1983 through 2000. The table presents means across all stock-year observations. Market cap is average month-end market cap in the ranking year. Annual turnover is the total CRSP dollar volume during the year scaled by market cap. Mean monthly market-adjusted returns are time-series means for portfolios constructed in the ranking year.
4.2 Univariate sorts
Our primary annual return results are presented in Table 3. Recall that we construct value-weighted and equally weighted portfolios formed in December of each year and held for 12 months. The most noteworthy result to emerge from this analysis is the spread in returns between stocks heavily bought and stocks heavily sold by individual investors (small trade columns).

Portfolios are formed in December of each year, 1983–2000, based on quintiles of proportion buys calculated using small trades or large trades. Portfolios are value weighted (by market cap) or equally weighted; each stock is held for 12 months. Market-adjusted returns (panel A) are the differences between the portfolio return and a value-weighted market index. Four-factor alphas(panelB)aretheinterceptsfromthefollowingregression:(Rpt −Rft)=α+β(Rmt −Rft)+sSMBt +vVMGt +wWMLt +εt,where Rpt isthemonthlyportfolioreturn, R f t is the monthly return on 1-month T-Bills, and SMB, VMG, and WML are factors representing size, value/growth, and momentum (winner/loser) tilts. Coefficient estimates from the regression are presented in panels C through F.

portfolios, the spread in the raw returns is −37 basis points per month (t = −2.21). This underperformance can be traced largely to the strong performance of stocks heavily sold by individuals. The value-weighted portfolio of stocks heavily sold by individuals beats the market by 38 bps per month (t = 2.58), while the value-weighted portfolio of stocks heavily bought by individuals essentially matches market rates of return.
To determine whether style tilts or factor loadings can explain the return spread, we estimate a four-factor model. We estimate a time-series regres- sion where the dependent variable is the monthly portfolio return less the risk-free rate and the four independent variables represent factors related to market, firm size, book-to-market ratio (value/growth), and momentum.12 Four- factor alphas for the value-weighted portfolios yield a similar return spread of 35 bps per month (t = 2.40), while stocks heavily sold by individual investors continue to earn strong four-factor alphas of 34 bps (t = 2.69). Factors related to market, size, value/growth, and momentum provide little explanatory power for the return spread.13
The 35 bps monthly return spread is economically large, translating into 4.2 percentage points annually. By comparison, during our sample period (1983– 2000) the mean monthly return on the market, size, value, and momentum factors are 69 bps (t = 2.24), −12 bps (t = −0.49), 34 bps (t = 1.46), and 92 bps (t = 3.11), respectively.
The return spread on equally weighted portfolios is greater than that based on value-weighted portfolios. The raw return spread between stocks heavily bought by individual investors and those sold grows to 44 bps per month (t = −2.99), while the four-factor alpha grows to 57 bps per month (t = −4.67). This is not terribly surprising, since the equally weighted portfolios heavily reflect the returns of small stocks, which individual investors are more likely to influence.
The return spread for portfolios formed on the basis of the proportion of buyer-initiated large trades is not reliably different from zero. The raw return
12 The factor data are from Ken French’s data library (mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_ library.html). The construction of these factors is described on the website.
13 In auxiliary analysis, we estimate monthly cross-sectional regressions where the proportion of buys from the retail datasets is the dependent variable and the proportion buyer-initiated trades from the TAQ trade size bins yield five independent variables. We use the mean results from these regressions to calculate predicted retail order imbalance in each year by applying the mean coefficient estimates from this regression to the annual proportion buyer-initiated trades in each of the five TAQ/ISSM trade size bins for our entire sample period (1983–2000). Finally, stocks are ranked based on predicted retail order imbalance in each year. We construct portfolios based on quintiles of predicted retail order imbalance and analyze the returns in the year following ranking. The results are qualitatively similar to, but somewhat weaker than, the results presented in Table 3. This loss of forecasting power may be due to noisy forecasts of retail order imbalance or it may be that because retail order imbalances include executed limit orders while signed small trades focus on market orders, thus providing a better measure of investor sentiment. In additional auxiliary analysis, we rank stocks into quartiles based on the number of months in the sorting year in which the percentage of small signed trades that are purchases is over 50%. We construct portfolios based on these persistence quartiles and analyze the returns in the year following ranking. Results for the monthly persistence measure are qualitatively similar to the percentage buy results presented in Table 3 (i.e., the portfolio of stocks with the fewest buy months underperforms the portfolio of stocks with the most buy months in the year following the ranking); monthly persistence results are somewhat stronger than our reported results for equally weighed portfolios and somewhat weaker for value-weighted portfolios.

spread is 5 bps per month, while the four-factor alpha for the long-short port- folio is 0.3 bps per month. Curiously, the middle portfolio (portfolio 3)—i.e., where the proportion of buyer-initiated large trades is roughly 0.5—earns strong returns. We have no ready explanation for this finding.
It is not surprising that large trades, though influential when executed, do not predict future returns. Though large trades are almost exclusively the province of institutions, institutions with superior information almost certainly break up their trades to hide their informational advantage among the trades of smaller, less informed, investors. Thus, the most informative institutional trades are not likely to be the largest trades. Consistent with this portrait of informed trading, Barclay and Warner (1993) provide evidence that medium-sized trades, which they define as trades between 500 and 9,900 shares, have the greatest price impact. Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify smaller institutional trades since they are effectively hiding among the trades of less informed investors. Thus, we are unable to provide a compelling test of the performance of institutional trades using the data presented here.
4.3 Two-way sorts
To investigate whether there is any interaction between the proportion of buyer- initiated trades based on individual and institutional trading, we estimate returns for 25 portfolios based on a five-by-five matrix of stocks sorted independently by (1) the proportion of buyer-initiated small trades and (2) the proportion of buyer-initiated large trades. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4, where rows represent the quintiles of the proportion of buyer-initiated large trades and columns present the quintiles of the proportion of buyer-initiated small trades. Of particular interest is the seventh column of numbers (small trade B − S), which presents the spread between the returns on portfolios of stocks heavily bought less the returns on stocks heavily sold by small traders for each of the five quintiles of large trade proportion buys. In four of the five large trade quintiles, the return spread is negative. Only among stocks heavily sold by institutions is there no economically meaningful spread between stocks bought and sold by small traders; for the remaining quintiles, the abnormal returns range from 22 to 49 bps per month when we analyze value-weighted returns (panel A) and 37 to 63 bps per month when we analyze equally weighted returns (panel B). The spread in returns between stocks bought and sold by small traders is 34 bps per month for stocks that are also traded by institutions (panel A, column 7, row 6), which is very similar to our main results in Table 3 that do not condition on the presence of large and small trades in the ranking year. Scanning the seventh row of numbers (large trade B − S), we again find little consistent evidence that the proportion buys based on large trades predict returns.
Of some note, the stocks with the highest proportion of both small and large buyer-initiated trades earn the lowest returns in the subsequent year, with aver- age four-factor alphas of −39 bps per month for the value-weighted portfolio

(t = −2.66) and −41 bps per month for the equal-weighted portfolio (t = −3.35). This suggests that buyer-initiated trading of a stock by both individ- ual and institutional investors in one year causes an overreaction resulting in underperformance in the subsequent year.
4.4 Results by idiosyncratic risk
Our story predicts stronger price reversals in stocks with more limited ar- bitrage opportunities. One measure of the limits of arbitrage is the extent to which a stock has readily available substitutes. Several papers (Ali, Hwang, and Trombley, 2003; Wurgler and Zhuravskaya, 2003; Mendenhall, 2004; Mushruwala, Rajgopal, and Shevlin, 2006; and Pontiff, 2006, among others) argue that stocks with high levels of idiosyncratic risk are more difficult to arbi- trage. While one can develop more refined measures (e.g., by searching across all stocks for close substitutes), the prior work in this area documents that a simple measure of idiosyncratic risk is highly correlated with more sophisti- cated measures. Consequently, we use the standard deviation of the monthly residual from a time-series regression of the firm excess returns on the market excess returns over the 48 months preceding the end of our ranking period as our measure of idiosyncratic risk. (Results are similar if we use the monthly residual from the Fama and French, 1993, three-factor model.) We then sepa- rately analyze return patterns for stocks in the bottom 30%, middle 40%, and top 30% based on this measure of idiosyncratic risk.
These results are presented in Table 5. To conserve space, we present only four-factor alphas for value-weighted portfolio returns. Market-adjusted returns and equally weighted returns yield qualitatively similar results. Sorting on idiosyncratic risk yields a sharp separation in returns. We find strong evidence that stocks with higher idiosyncratic risk have stronger reversals; stocks in the top 30% of our measure of idiosyncratic risk yield a return spread of −110 bps per month (t = −2.64), while stocks in the middle 40% and bottom 30% yield return spreads of only −38 bps per months (t = −1.44) and −29 bps per month (t = −1.56), respectively.
Both small firms and firms with high levels of idiosyncratic risk are difficult to arbitrage. However, we expect larger price impacts for small firms not only because they are difficult to arbitrage but also because the price impact of correlated retail trading is likely to be greatest for small firms.
Firm size and idiosyncratic risk are negatively correlated; the typical correla- tion in our sample is about −50%. To disentangle whether the results in Table 5 are merely driven by firm size, we conduct the following auxiliary analysis. We identify small, medium, and large firms using NYSE breakpoints. Small firms are those below the 30th percentile of NYSE market cap, while large firms are those above the 70th percentile. Remaining firms are classified as medium sized. Within each firm size category, we partition firms based on idiosyncratic risk as above. By construction, the high-, medium-, and low-idiosyncratic-risk portfolios have roughly equal representation of small, medium, and large firms.

Panel C: Low idiosyncratic risk
Portfolios of low, medium, and high idiosyncratic risk are formed in December of each year, 1983–2000, based on quintiles of proportion buyer-initiated trades calculated using small trades or large trades. Idiosyncratic risk is measured as the residual standard deviation from a regression of firm returns less the risk-free rate on the market return less the risk-free rate over four years preceding the ranking month. Stocks are ranked into low (bottom 30%), medium (middle 40%), and high (top 30%) idiosyncratic risk partitions. Four-factor alphas are the intercepts from the time-series regressions of the excess portfolio return on factors related to the market, size, book-to-market (value/growth), and momentum.
The results of this analysis indicate larger return spreads for the high- idiosyncratic-risk size-neutral portfolios. For the high-idiosyncratic-risk port- folio, the equally weighted return spread is −117 bps (t = −4.05), while the value-weighted return spread is −54 bps (t = −1.70). For the low-idiosyncratic- risk portfolio, the equally weighted return spread is −26 bps per month (t = −2.37), while the value-weighted return spread is −34 bps per month (t = −1.65). The differences in the return spreads between the high- and low- idiosyncratic-risk partitions are statistically significant for the equally weighted portfolio (t = −3.09), but not for the value-weighted portfolios (t = −0.51). The strength of the equally weighted results indicates that idiosyncratic risk is most influential in predicting return reversals among small firms.
4.5 Results by small trade turnover
We expect the influence of small traders to be greatest when small traders are active. To measure the activity of small traders, we calculate small trade turnover, which we define as the sum of signed small trades divided by average monthly market cap during the ranking year. We then partition stocks into

High-small-trade-turnover stocks are those above the 70th percentile of turnover within the year, while low-small- trade-turnover stocks are those below the 30th percentile of turnover. Remaining stocks are placed in the medium-trade-turnover category. As was done for our main results, we calculate value-weighted portfolio returns separately for each turnover group.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6. To conserve space, we present only four-factor alphas for value-weighted portfolio returns.

In contrast, the return spread for medium- and high-turnover groups are reliably negative and economically large: 48 bps per month (t = 2.50) and 112 bps per month (t = 2.58).

4.6 One-week calendar time return analysis
Having established that the trading behavior of individual investors in one year forecasts cross-sectional stock returns the following year, we turn our attention to shorter horizons.
First, we measure the contemporaneous relationship between the weekly order imbalance of small and large trades and returns the same week by con- structing portfolios as before using weekly rather than annual order imbalance. Specifically, on Wednesday of each week we rank stocks into quintiles based on the proportion of buys using small trades. The value-weighted returns on the portfolio are calculated for the contemporaneous week. We obtain a time series of daily returns for each quintile. We compound the daily returns to obtain a monthly return series. We conduct a similar analysis for portfolios constructed based on the proportion buys using large trades.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table 7, panel A. For both large and small trades, contemporaneous returns are strongly increasing in the proportion of trades that are purchases. Causality could go in either direction or both. That is, an imbalance of purchases (sales) could drive prices up (down) or investors may choose to buy (sell) stocks that are going up (down). We do not attempt to determine causality here. Others who have looked at the relationship

Do Retail Trades Move Markets?
between contemporaneous retail investor flows and returns have found evidence of causality in both directions (e.g., Goetzmann and Massa, 2003; and Agnew and Balduzzi, 2005).
Next we examine the ability of one week’s order imbalance to forecast the subsequent week’s cross-sectional returns. To calibrate the size of the abnormal returns that one might observe from pursuing a strategy of investing in stocks recently bought by small traders, we construct portfolios as before using weekly rather than annual order imbalance. Specifically, on Wednesday of each week we rank stock into quintiles based on the proportion of buys using small trades. The value-weighted returns on the portfolio are calculated for the subsequent week (five trading days). Thus, in contrast to our main results, where we rank stocks annually and hold them for one year, in this analysis we rank stock weekly and hold them for one week. Ultimately, we obtain a time series of daily returns for each quintile. We compound the daily returns to obtain a monthly return series. Again, we conduct a similar analysis for portfolios constructed based on the proportion buys using large trades.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table 7, panel B. Stocks recently sold by small traders perform poorly (−64 bps per month, t = −5.16), while stocks recently bought by small traders perform well (73 bps per month, t = 5.22). Note this return predictability represents a short-run continuation rather than reversal of returns; stocks with a high weekly proportion of buys perform well both in the week of strong buying and the subsequent week. This runs counter to the well-documented presence of short-term reversals in weekly returns.14, 15
Portfolios based on the proportion of buys using large trades yield precisely the opposite result. Stocks bought by large traders perform poorly in the sub- sequent week (−36 bps per month, t = −3.96), while those sold perform well (42 bps per month, t = 3.57).
We find a positive relationship between the weekly proportion of buyer- initiated small trades in a stock and contemporaneous returns. Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (forthcoming) find retail investors to be contrarians over one-week horizons, tending to sell more so than buy stocks with strong performance. Like
14 Stocks with many buyer-initiated trades in period t are more likely to have an end-of-period price posted at the ask, while stocks with many seller-initiated trades in period t are more likely to have an end-of-period price posted at the bid. Thus, absent other effects, we would expect stocks heavily bought to have negative returns in period t + 1 if the closing price at period t + 1 is equally likely to be a bid or ask, while (for similar reasons) stocks heavily sold would have positive returns in period t + 1. The size of these reversals would depend on the size of the percentage spread. This microstructure effect works against our finding that stocks with more buyer (seller) initiated small trades one week have strong (weak) returns the next, but could contribute to the opposite pattern for large trades.
15 Gervais, Kaniel, and Minglegrin (2001) find that stocks with an unusually high (low) trading volume over a day or a week tend to appreciate (depreciate) over the subsequent month. We find a positive relationship between turnover and individual investor order imbalance at an annual horizon (Table 2). In unreported analysis (available from the authors), we find the same relationship at horizons of one week and one month. Barber and Odean (forthcoming) report a strong positive relationship between individual investor order imbalance and abnormal trading volume on a daily basis. Individual investor order imbalance (and its persistence) may contribute to the relationship that Gervais, Kaniel, and Minglegrin (2001) document between volume and subsequent returns.

us, they find that stocks bought by individual investors one week outperform the subsequent week. They suggest that individual investors profit in the short run by supplying liquidity to institutional investors whose aggressive trades drive prices away from fundamental value and benefiting when prices bounce back. Barber et al. (2005) document that individual investors can earn short- term profits by supplying liquidity. This story is consistent with the one-week reversals we see in stocks bought and sold with large trades. Aggressive large purchases may drive prices temporarily too high while aggressive large sells drive them too low both leading to reversals the subsequent week. However, the provision of immediate liquidity by individual investors does not explain the small trade results presented here (nor is it likely to contribute appreciably to our annual horizon results). Unlike Kaniel, Saar, and Titman’s investor sentiment measure, our imbalance measure is unlikely to include liquidity supplying trades since the algorithm we use to sign trades is specifically designed to identify buyer- and seller-initiated trades. We suspect that, consistent with the investor sentiment models discussed above, when buying (selling) pressure by individual investors pushes prices up (down) in the current week, continued buying (selling) pressure push prices further up (down) the following week. If so, then prices are being distorted in the direction of individual investor trades and we would expect to find evidence of subsequent reversals.
4.7 Weekly Fama-Macbeth regressions
To explore this issue, we estimate a series of cross-sectional regressions where the dependent variable is weekly returns and the independent variables capture the pattern of past trading activity by small traders.

where the dependent variable is the percentage log return for a firm in week t (rt).16 The independent variables of interest include four weekly lags of the proportion of buys based on small trades (PBt−1 to PBt−4) and twelve lags of proportion buys for four-week periods beginning in t − 5 (PBt−5,t−8 to PBt−49,t−52). As control variables, we include a firm’s book-to-market ratio (BM) and firm size (MVE, i.e., log of market value of equity) to control for size and value effects (Fama and French, 1992), four lags of weekly returns (rt−1 to

rt−4) to control for well-documented short-term reversals (Lehmann, 1990; and Jegadeesh, 1990), and the firm return between weeks t − 52 to t − 5 (rt−52,t−5) to control for momentum in returns (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993). The typical week has 1,900 firms included in the cross-sectional regression with a range of 267 firms for the week of March 28, 1984 (before the availability of NASDAQ data) to a maximum of 3,566 in the week of January 12, 2000; twenty-four weeks are missing between 1984 and 1990 due to missing ISSM data. Statistical inference is based on the mean coefficient estimates and standard error of the mean across 860 weekly regressions.
These results are presented in Figure 2, where we plot the coefficient esti- mates on lags of proportion buys. As the figure makes clear, consistent with our weekly calendar time results, but in striking contrast to our annual results, recent buying by small traders is positively, rather than negatively, related to current returns. The results at one and two weeks are statistically significant (t = 29.97 and t = 6.45 for lags of one and two weeks, respectively) and eco- nomically large. For example, ceteris paribus, if 60%, rather than 50%, of the small trades in a stock were buyer initiated in the past week, the stock would earn a log return that is 18 bps higher during the current week.
Consistent with our annual results, current weekly returns are generally negatively related to buying by small traders in the past 5–52 weeks. The negative effects are most pronounced for weeks t − 5 to t − 8 and generally shrink in economic and statistical significance as we move to longer lags.
Thus, consistent with investor sentiment models, the aggressive purchases (sales) of stocks by individual investors coincide with price increases (de- creases) that, eventually, reverse.
5. An Alternative Explanation
An alternative explanation for our annual results is offered by an anonymous referee. In this story, individuals provide liquidity to institutions. Institutions begin selling stocks that they believe to be overvalued. The overvaluation that institutions perceive could be driven by changes in firms’ fundamental values. Individuals notice falling prices for some stocks and purchase stocks for prices that appear to them to be below intrinsic values. Individuals then wind up holding overvalued stocks, and the long-run returns of the stocks they purchase are negative, reflecting the information of the institutions that sold them the stocks.
This story is similar to that proposed by Kaniel, Saar and Titman (forthcom- ing) in which individual investors provide liquidity to institutional investors. However, in Kaniel, Saar, and Titman, institutions demand liquidity over peri- ods of days, not months or years. In this alternative story, market inefficiencies do not result from the biases of individual investors but, rather, from the inability of institutional investors to immediately identify and correct mispricings. Once recognized, mispricings can require 1–2 years to correct. This story predicts

Independent variables include PB, the proportion buys based on small trades (where lags are included for the past year); BM, book-to-market ratio; MVE, log of market value of equity; r, lags of weekly returns (percentage log returns for four weeks leading up to week t and the compound return from week t − 52 to t − 5).

that prices fall as individual investors buy. The theory we are testing predicts prices rise as individual investors buy. Consistent with our theory, we find that, at weekly horizons, the proportion of small trades that are buyer initiated and contemporaneous returns are positively correlated (Table 7, panel A).
At annual horizons, the evidence is not as straightforward. When stocks are sorted into quintiles on the basis of the proportion of small trades that are buyer initiated, equally weighted portfolios of stocks in quintiles with more buyer- initiated trades have higher returns in the sorting year than do portfolios with more seller-initiated trades (Table 2, bottom of panel A). However, this pattern

Stocks are sorted into quintiles based on the proportion buyer-initiated trades calculated using small trades during that day or month. Mean market-adjusted returns (firm return less value-weighted market index) across all firms and days (or months) are reported for the extreme quintiles (i.e., 1 and 5) weighted in proportion to market capitalization. Small firms are those below the 30th percentile of NYSE market cap, while large firms are those above the 70th percentile. Remaining firms are classified as medium sized.
does not hold when portfolios are weighted by each firm’s market capitalization; now quintiles with more buyer-initiated trades have lower returns in the sorting year.
Differences in the behavior of equally weighted and value-weighted portfo- lios often result from differences in the behavior of large and small firms. We conduct the following analyses to test for differences across firm size categories. On each day, we rank stocks into quintiles based on the daily proportion of signed small trades that are buyer initiated (requiring a minimum of 10 trades). We then calculate the returns for these stocks during the ranking day. For each quintile, the mean abnormal return is calculated weighted by the market cap of each firm. We separately analyze small, medium, and large firms. We repeat the same analysis, basing our rankings on monthly and annual rather than daily order imbalance. Results for the extreme quintiles are reported in Table 8.
At a daily horizon, the returns are consistent with the direction of order imbalance and the relation is stronger for small than for medium and large firms. At a monthly horizon, the pattern of returns of small firm returns is still consistent with order imbalance. But medium and large firm returns are negative in months when individuals are net buyers and positive when they are net sellers. We know from prior work (e.g., Odean, 1999) that the buying and selling decisions of individual investors are quite sensitive to past returns. Measuring returns and individual investor trading imbalance during the same month (or year) conflates the contemporaneous impact of trading on returns with the impact of recent returns on individual investor trading decisions.
To better understand the timing of these returns within a month, we plot cumulative abnormal returns around the ranking day. We separate our sample into small, medium, and large stocks and sort stocks each day into quintiles based on the proportion of small trades that are buyer initiated. On each event day, we calculate the market-adjusted return for each stock (firm return less value-weighted market return). Weighted mean market-adjusted returns are calculated on each event day, where market capitalization from the beginning of the analysis period is used to weight returns on all event days. Cumulative market-adjusted returns (CARs) are the sum of daily mean market-adjusted

Daily (panel A) and monthly (panel B) CARs for extreme quintiles of proportion buyer-initiated small trades: February 1983 to December 2000
Stocks are sorted into quintiles based on proportion buyer-initiated trades calculated using small trades. Small firms are those below the 30th percentile of NYSE market cap, while large firms are those above the 70th percentile. Remaining firms are classified as medium sized. Mean returns across all stocks and days are weighted by market cap.
returns. In Figure 3, panel A, daily CARs are plotted separately for small, medium, and large firms.
The patterns of returns leading up to the ranking day are consistent across the different size partitions. Stocks with a high proportion of sells on the ranking day experience strong returns prior to the ranking day, while stocks with a high proportion of buys on the ranking day experience poor prior returns. Importantly, the pattern of returns leading up to the ranking day is stronger than the returns on the ranking day for medium and large stocks. In contrast, for small stocks where the impact of these small trades is (relatively) large, the pattern of returns leading up to the ranking day is weaker than the returns on the ranking day.
These daily patterns of returns likely explain the apparently inconsistent monthly returns that we observe in Table 8. For example, large firms with a large proportion of buys earn negative returns of 79 bps in the ranking month. This is consistent with the daily pattern that we observe in Figure 3, panel A, where stocks with a high proportion of buys earn poor returns in the days prior to ranking. For big firms, where the price impact of small trades is relatively small, it is almost certainly the case that the negative returns preceding individual investor net buying are the predominant reason we observe negative returns in months with a high proportion of buyer-initiated small trades.

In the main analyses in this paper, we analyze returns based on ranking periods of one year. During the ranking year, equally weighted portfolios earn returns consistent with the direction of order imbalance, but value-weighted portfolios do not (see Table 2, bottom of panel A). The difference in value- weighted and equally weighted results suggests different patterns for small and large firms. In auxiliary analyses, we confirm small firms earn returns during the ranking year that are consistent with the direction of trades, medium and big firms do not.17 Again, we believe that the most likely explanation is the pattern of returns leading up to these trades within the year.
Within a sorting year, an average of six months of returns will precede a trade. In Figure 3, panel B, we plot monthly CARs for monthly order im- balance quintiles. For small firms, over the six months preceding the sorting month, stocks predominantly bought during the sorting month outperform those predominantly sold; only in the two months leading up to the sorting month does this pattern reverse. For medium and large firms, during the six months preceding the sorting month, stocks predominantly bought in the sorting month underperform those predominantly sold; on average, individual investors are net buyers of stocks with significant recent losses and net sellers of stocks with significant recent gains. The negative relationship we observe between annual returns for medium and large stocks and net individual buying during the same year appears to be driven by returns in the months leading up to individual investor trading. Thus, we are able to reconcile the annual contemporaneous returns of medium and large stocks with our theory; however, these returns are also consistent with the alternative explanation.
Imbalances in buyer- and seller-initiated trades move prices. The impact is greatest for small firms that are likely to be more difficult to arbitrage and to have greater individual investor trading turnover. The negative relationship we document between the annual proportion of signed small trades that are buyer initiated and returns in the subsequent year is strongest for such firms. This relationship supports the theory that the trades of individual investors move prices away from fundamental value.
6. Conclusion
In theoretical models of investor sentiment, trading by not fully rational traders can drive prices away from fundamental values. Risk-averse informed traders cannot eliminate mispricing due to limits of arbitrage. When uninformed traders actively buy, assets become overpriced; when they actively sell, assets become underpriced. Eventually, asset prices are likely to revert toward fundamental values.
17 Table 2, panel A, reports a monthly market-adjusted return for the value-weighted portfolios of stocks heavily sold (quintile 1) and bought (quintile 5) of 39 bps and 4 bps, respectively. The corresponding value-weighted returns with small, medium, and large firms are small sold (−59 bps), small buy (52 bps), medium sold (40 bps), medium buy (−8 bps), big sold (49 bps), and big buy (5 bps).

In this paper, we analyze eighteen years of tick-by-tick transactional data for U.S stocks. First, we document that signed small trades provide a reason- able proxy for the trading of individual investors. We externally validate that small trades from transactional data that have been signed using algorithms developed by Lee and Ready (1991) and Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara (2000) provide a reasonable proxy for the trading of individual investors; we do so by correlating the order imbalance based on small trades to order imbalance based on individual investor trades at a retail and discount brokerage firm during the 1990s. Second, using small trades as a proxy for the trading behavior of individual investors, we find that the buyer-initiated (and seller-initiated) trades of individual investors are highly correlated; that is, in any given month indi- vidual investors systematically buy some stocks and sell others. Furthermore, individual investors tend to buy (or sell) the same stocks one month as they did the previous month.
Over short horizons our evidence is consistent with noise trader models in which the buying (selling) of retail investors push prices too high (low) leading to subsequent reversals. We find that weekly imbalances in buyer- and seller- initiated small trades (trades of less than $5,000 in 1991 dollars) are correlated with contemporaneous returns and, more importantly, forecast cross-sectional differences in returns for the subsequent week. Stocks that individual investors are buying (selling) during one week have positive (negative) abnormal returns that week and in the subsequent two weeks. These returns then reverse over the next several months.
Over annual horizons, our evidence that retail investors move prices is mixed. Smaller capitalization stock prices rise (fall) during years in which retail in- vestors are net buyers (sellers), but medium and large capitalization stock prices fall (rise) during years in which retail investors are net buyers (sellers). While medium and large stock prices do rise (fall) during days or weeks of intense retail investor buying (selling), the negative correlation between annual retail investor buying and stock returns for medium and large stocks is consistent with an alternative explanation where individual investors are providing liquidity to institutions who are selling overvalued stocks and buying undervalued stocks (see Section 5).
For small, medium, and large stocks, annual retail buy imbalances forecast the next year’s return. Calculating imbalances in buyer- and seller-initiated small trades annually, we document that the quintile of stocks with the highest proportion of buyer-initiated small trades underperforms the quintile with the lowest proportion of buyer-initiated small trades by 4.4 percentage points over the next year. In contrast, the quintile of stocks with the highest proportion of buyer-initiated large trades (trades of over $50,000 in 1991 dollars) earn returns that are not reliably different from those earned by the quintile with the lowest proportion of buyer-initiated large trades. The ability of small trades to forecast future returns is weakest for large capitalization firms and greatest for stocks for which arbitrage is difficult, such as those with greater idiosyncratic risk, and for stocks in which individual investors trade most intensely. For

high-idiosyncratic-risk stocks, the quintile of stocks with the highest propor- tion of buyer-initiated small trades underperforms the quintile with the lowest proportion of buyer-initiated small trades by a (four-factor) risk-adjusted 13.2 percentage points over the next year. For those stocks with the highest intensity of individual investor trades, this underperformance is an annual risk-adjusted 13.5 percentage points.
We conclude that over both short and long horizons, retail trade imbalances forecast future returns. Over short horizons, such as a day or week, retail trades move stock prices in the direction of their trades. Over long horizons like a year, the retail trades move only the prices of small stocks in the direction of their trade. In combination the contemporaneous price moves and subsequent reversals suggest that retail trades move markets—particularly among small stocks, where the trades of retail investors are most likely to be influential.
