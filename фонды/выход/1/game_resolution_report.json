                    "reasoning": "The proposal by 'Форум Reddit' aligns with my desires to achieve profit and confront large market players. By establishing a decentralized, community-driven investment simulation platform, it offers the opportunity to collectively test and refine investment strategies, which can enhance my knowledge and confidence as an individual investor. The potential to achieve a consistent annual return of 10% by allocating 30% of the portfolio to index funds is appealing, as it mitigates the fear of losing investments. Overall, this proposal appears to provide a balanced approach to maximizing returns while reducing risks.",
