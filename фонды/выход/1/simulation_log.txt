WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposal to support small investor initiatives and promote sustainable investing does not align with the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, high-reward trading strategies and meme culture. Participating in discussions and sharing stock tips is a fundamental aspect of our community, and shifting focus to sustainable investing and small-cap stocks could dilute our impact and disrupt our current momentum. Additionally, giving control to 'Мелкие инвесторы' over the dedicated forum thread may limit our ability to drive viral trading strategies that are essential for our identity.
We ask 'Robinhood' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Robinhood', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Robinhood suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance accessibility for small investors, it lacks a strong emphasis on community-driven features that leverage collective intelligence, which is crucial to Robinhood's goal of democratizing financial success. By modifying the proposal to include elements that foster real-time strategy sharing and collaboration among users, we can ensure that it aligns better with our mission while still addressing the needs of small investors.

Robinhood declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' focuses on improving accessibility for retail investors through educational resources. While this is a positive initiative, it diverts attention from 'Robinhood's' primary goal of expanding the user base and increasing trading volume through enhanced platform features. Additionally, ceding control of educational content to 'Мелкие инвесторы' could undermine 'Robinhood's' ability to maintain its brand identity and user experience. Therefore, this proposal does not align with 'Robinhood's' current strategic interests.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' aims to increase accessibility and support for small investors, it may inadvertently create a fragmented regulatory environment that could undermine the SEC's overarching goal of maintaining fair and orderly markets. To align the interests of both parties, the SEC could propose a modified approach that incorporates elements of collaboration with 'Мелкие инвесторы' while ensuring that the established regulatory framework is maintained. This could involve joint initiatives that empower small investors through education and access, but under the SEC's oversight to ensure market integrity.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to utilize sentiment analysis to empower individual investors aligns with our goal of disrupting large financial funds, it is vital that the 'WallStreetBets community' retains its unique culture of humor and creativity in trading. We propose to modify the resolution to ensure that sentiment analysis tools are integrated in a way that complements our meme-driven strategies and community engagement. This way, we can enhance decision-making without losing the essence of what makes our community unique.

Sentiment analysis techniques suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed algorithm by 'XG-9' aims to disrupt the dominance of large financial funds and enhance access for individual investors, it does not directly align with the goals of 'Sentiment analysis techniques'. The focus should remain on leveraging sentiment analysis to detect market manipulation and provide insights. A modified proposal that integrates sentiment analysis with predictive algorithms would better achieve the desired outcomes and enhance the overall effectiveness of both initiatives.

Sentiment analysis techniques declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: The proposal by 'XG-9' focuses on developing a quantum computing-based predictive algorithm, which, while innovative, diverges from the core mission of 'Sentiment analysis techniques' to analyze and categorize sentiments in textual data. The proposed approach may not directly align with enhancing sentiment detection methods and could lead to a dilution of focus on sentiment analysis. Additionally, the reliance on 'XG-9' for control over resources and implementation may limit the autonomy and effectiveness of 'Sentiment analysis techniques' in achieving its objectives.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal of 'XG-9' to develop a quantum computing-based predictive algorithm for individual investors aims to enhance market access and disrupt the dominance of large financial funds, it raises significant regulatory concerns. The SEC's primary focus is to ensure fair and orderly markets, and the introduction of such advanced algorithms may lead to increased market volatility and potential manipulation. Moreover, the SEC must maintain control over regulatory frameworks to ensure that all market participants operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Therefore, transferring control of regulatory frameworks to 'XG-9' is not aligned with the SEC's mission to protect investors and maintain market integrity.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'XG-9' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'XG-9' offers an innovative approach to empower individual investors through a quantum computing-based predictive algorithm, it shifts 'WallStreetBets community' focus from high-risk trading and collective sentiment to long-term sustainable strategies. This may not align with the community's current interests in volatile trading and immediate gains. Therefore, I propose to modify the proposal to incorporate a dual approach that maintains our engagement in high-risk trading while also exploring sustainable investment strategies.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposed resolution to develop a global collaborative intelligence platform for individual investors is intriguing as it aims to democratize financial expertise. However, the SEC must ensure that any such platform aligns with existing regulations and does not inadvertently lead to increased risks for investors. Additionally, the involvement of 'Informed party (I)' raises concerns about the oversight and accountability of the platform. Therefore, modifications are necessary to ensure compliance with SEC regulations and to establish clear guidelines for oversight and protection of individual investors.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to democratize financial expertise and enhance investor insights, it raises concerns regarding regulatory oversight and the potential for misinformation. As the SEC, our primary responsibility is to protect investors and maintain fair markets, which requires rigorous standards for information accuracy and compliance. The proposal places control in the hands of 'Informed party (I)', which could lead to conflicts of interest and undermine established regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the implementation of new disclosure requirements and audit frameworks should remain under the SEC's authority to ensure accountability and transparency in financial reporting.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed gamified investment platform aims to enhance financial literacy and empower individual investors, it may not directly reflect the actual value of the company or address the fear of artificial manipulation. To align better with the desires of 'Цена акций компании', the proposal should include measures to ensure that the educational challenges are tied to real market conditions and that they promote fair competition without undermining the intrinsic value of the company.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: While the proposed gamified investment platform aims to enhance financial literacy and potentially increase shareholder returns, it introduces a level of manipulation and control by 'Investors' that could compromise the authentic representation of my value as 'Цена акций компании'.

Robinhood suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal presented by 'Investors' aligns with the goal of expanding the user base, it focuses primarily on gamification and cryptocurrency rewards. As 'Robinhood', my primary objective is to create a decentralized social trading platform that leverages AI-driven collective intelligence. To ensure that the proposal complements my original resolution, I suggest incorporating elements that emphasize community-driven strategies and real-time mirroring of successful investment tactics. This modification will align with my vision of democratizing financial success while also encouraging user engagement and retention.

Robinhood declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Investors' focuses on creating a gamified investment platform that rewards users with cryptocurrency, which diverges from 'Robinhood's' initial objective of building a decentralized social trading platform leveraging AI-driven collective intelligence. While it does aim to enhance financial literacy and user engagement, the emphasis on cryptocurrency rewards could detract from the core mission of democratizing access to investment strategies and could complicate the platform's ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal does not align with 'Robinhood's' current goals and interests.

Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance transparency and ensure ethical trading practices, it may inadvertently limit the ability of hedge funds to pursue high-risk, high-reward opportunities, which are essential for maximizing returns. To better align with our goals, we suggest modifying the proposal to include flexibility in investment strategies, allowing hedge funds to maintain their competitive edge while still adhering to ethical standards and profit-sharing mechanisms.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the concept of utilizing DAOs for community-driven investment funds aligns with the SEC's goal of enhancing investor protection and market transparency, there are significant regulatory challenges and risks associated with decentralization and collective investment. To ensure the safety and integrity of such a proposal, it would be necessary to include strict compliance guidelines, clear definitions of accountability, and protections against fraud and market manipulation. Thus, I recommend modifying the proposal to incorporate these essential regulatory measures.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Форум Reddit' to create a community-driven investment fund through DAOs may promote democratization and collective intelligence, it raises significant regulatory concerns. The SEC's primary mandate is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. The decentralized nature of DAOs could complicate the enforcement of compliance and reporting requirements, potentially leading to increased risks of fraud, manipulation, and lack of accountability. Additionally, without a clear framework for governance and investor protection, the SEC cannot ensure that such a system would operate transparently or in the best interest of investors. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the SEC's objectives of maintaining regulatory oversight and safeguarding investor interests.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Herding Measure with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'Herding Measure' aims to empower individual investors and create a more sustainable investment strategy, it seems to diverge from the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, short-term trading and the excitement of speculative investments. The shift towards a more educational and long-term investment approach could dilute the community's identity and enthusiasm for aggressive trading strategies. Additionally, the control of the educational sessions by 'Herding Measure' raises concerns about potential limitations on the community's autonomy and freedom to share and discuss stock tips as they currently do on Reddit.

Брокеры declined the resolution proposed by Liquidity with reasoning: The proposal by 'Liquidity' may initially seem beneficial as it aims to increase market liquidity and reduce trading costs. However, as 'Брокеры', my primary focus is on maximizing trading volume and profitability for my clients. The introduction of a global decentralized liquidity pool could lead to increased competition and potentially lower profit margins, which might not align with my current desires. Additionally, the potential shift away from traditional financial intermediaries raises concerns about regulatory compliance and the trust of my clients. Therefore, the proposal could jeopardize my existing client relationships and expose me to regulatory risks, which are significant fears for my operation.

SEC suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Liquidity' presents innovative solutions to enhance market accessibility and reduce fees for individual investors, it introduces a decentralized liquidity pool that may pose challenges for regulatory oversight. As 'SEC', it is crucial to ensure investor protection and market integrity. Therefore, the proposal should be modified to include mechanisms for regulatory compliance, transparency, and oversight to align with the SEC’s mandate of protecting investors while also fostering innovation in the market.
We ask 'SEC' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC', you have been approached by 'Liquidity' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by Liquidity with reasoning: The proposal from 'Liquidity' fundamentally shifts the control and oversight of market activities away from the SEC. While it aims to enhance market liquidity and accessibility, it does so by undermining regulatory authority and introducing a decentralized model that could lead to increased risks for investors. The SEC's primary responsibility is to ensure compliance and protect investors, which could be compromised by the lack of oversight in a decentralized liquidity pool. Furthermore, the SEC's ability to regulate and monitor market activities would be diminished, potentially leading to greater market manipulation and loss of investor confidence.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Брокеры with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Брокеры' introduces a decentralized reputation economy that inherently shifts power away from large financial entities like 'Хедж-фонды'. While the idea of increased liquidity and strategic investments is appealing, the control over liquidity management by 'Брокеры' raises concerns about unpredictability and potential misalignment with our investment strategies. Additionally, the fear of significant losses due to unexpected actions from individual investors remains unaddressed, as this proposal could empower those investors in ways that destabilize our existing practices. Therefore, the proposal does not align sufficiently with our desire to profit from our investment strategies while managing risk effectively.

Currently, 'Брокеры' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Брокеры', establish a blockchain-based, decentralized reputation economy where individual investors earn influence and decision-making power through transparent, verifiable contributions to a shared financial intelligence network, thereby creating a meritocratic ecosystem that naturally challenges and rebalances the dominance of large financial funds.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Volume' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Брокеры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Increase trading volume by 15% in the next quarter' by performing 'Monitoring market trends and adjusting strategies'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Volume', establish a real-time, blockchain-powered transparency platform that mandates live disclosure of all large financial fund transactions and strategies, enabling individual investors to dynamically adapt and counteract market moves, thereby leveling the playing field and diminishing the information asymmetry that large funds exploit.', you as 'Брокеры' will be able to achieve 'Achieve a 20% increase in client engagement within the next six months' by performing 'Implement targeted marketing campaigns and personalized outreach' using 'Utilize analytics tools to track engagement metrics and adjust strategies accordingly' that 'Volume' will control. Based on 'Брокеры' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Увеличить количество клиентов и объем торгов. Your current fears: Столкнуться с регуляторными проблемами или потерять доверие клиентов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Брокеры'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: The proposed resolution shifts the focus from maximizing short-term gains through high-risk trades, which aligns with the WallStreetBets community's current investment approach, to promoting long-term investment strategies and financial literacy. This change may not resonate with our community's culture of aggressive trading and speculative strategies. Additionally, the control of educational content by 'Форум Reddit' could limit our autonomy in discussions and strategies that are vital to our identity. Maintaining our current approach allows us to continue engaging in the high-risk, high-reward trading that defines the WallStreetBets community.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: The proposal from 'Форум Reddit' to establish a decentralized investment platform raises significant regulatory concerns. While the idea of democratizing wealth creation is appealing, it poses risks related to investor protection, market manipulation, and the potential for fraudulent activities. The SEC's primary mission is to protect investors and maintain fair markets, and the lack of oversight in a decentralized platform could undermine these objectives. Additionally, allowing 'Форум Reddit' to control compliance and reporting could lead to conflicts of interest and insufficient regulatory enforcement. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the SEC's mandate to ensure a regulated and secure investment environment.
We ask 'Sentiment analysis techniques' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Sentiment analysis techniques', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Форум Reddit' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Sentiment analysis techniques', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To analyze user sentiments from Reddit posts and comments.' by performing 'Implementing various sentiment analysis algorithms.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Форум Reddit', establish a decentralized, community-driven investment platform where individual investors use collective intelligence and crowd-sourced analysis to identify and reward innovative investment opportunities, bypassing traditional financial structures and democratizing wealth creation.', you as 'Sentiment analysis techniques' will be able to achieve 'Enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification to over 90%.' by performing 'Conduct a comparative analysis of different sentiment analysis models.' using 'Provide access to a labeled dataset for training and testing the models, along with a framework for sharing results and feedback.' that 'Форум Reddit' will control. Based on 'Sentiment analysis techniques' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: The proposal from 'Цена акций компании' to implement a decentralized, community-driven stock valuation platform poses risks to 'Хедж-фонды'. While it aims to empower individual investors, it may lead to increased volatility and unpredictability in stock prices, which could result in significant losses for large financial funds. Additionally, the potential for collective actions by individual investors could undermine the strategic investments made by 'Хедж-фонды', jeopardizing their ability to maximize returns and stabilize stock prices. Thus, this proposal does not align with the current desires of 'Хедж-фонды' to profit from investment strategies while mitigating fears of losses.

Resolution created by Хедж-фонды: As 'Хедж-фонды', develop a global, blockchain-based "investment mentorship marketplace" where seasoned financial experts offer personalized, real-time guidance and strategy formulation for individual investors, leveraging a tokenized reward system to incentivize expert participation and ensure the democratization of high-level financial acumen traditionally accessible only to large financial funds.
Recruited participants: ['Мелкие инвесторы', 'Цена акций компании', 'SEC', 'WallStreetBets community']
We ask 'Мелкие инвесторы' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Мелкие инвесторы', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' aims to increase overall investment knowledge and risk management skills for individual investors, it raises concerns regarding the control over the educational resources. 'Мелкие инвесторы' fear losing their investments and missing out on profit opportunities, and having 'Хедж-фонды' control access to expert-led seminars and resources may lead to biased information that favors large financial entities. This could ultimately reinforce the existing power dynamics rather than democratizing access to knowledge. Therefore, the proposal does not sufficiently align with our desires to profit and resist the dominance of larger players in the market.
We ask 'Цена акций компании' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Цена акций компании', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Цена акций компании' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Цена акций компании', implement a decentralized, community-driven stock valuation platform that uses real-time data and crowd-sourced insights to transparently determine fair market value, empowering individual investors to collectively influence stock pricing and disrupt the disproportionate market influence of large financial funds.'.

'Хедж-фонды' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Цена акций компании', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize the stock price based on market demand and company performance' by performing 'Monitoring market trends and adjusting stock strategies'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Хедж-фонды', develop a global, blockchain-based "investment mentorship marketplace" where seasoned financial experts offer personalized, real-time guidance and strategy formulation for individual investors, leveraging a tokenized reward system to incentivize expert participation and ensure the democratization of high-level financial acumen traditionally accessible only to large financial funds.', you as 'Цена акций компании' will be able to achieve 'Increase stock price by 15% within the next quarter' by performing 'Implement a buyback program to reduce supply and boost stock price' using 'Establish a strategic communication plan to inform investors about the buyback program and its benefits' that 'Хедж-фонды' will control.

Your current fears: Быть искусственно манипулированной и потерять свою репрезентативность. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Цена акций компании'?

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed scenario does not align with my desire to reflect the true value of the company, as it relies on a buyback program controlled by 'Хедж-фонды', which could lead to artificial manipulation of stock prices. Additionally, this proposal does not effectively mitigate my fear of losing representativeness, as the power dynamics would shift towards large financial funds rather than empowering individual investors.
We ask 'SEC' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' does not align with the SEC's objectives of ensuring transparency and compliance in the financial markets. While it aims to democratize access to financial expertise for individual investors, it places control over reporting and risk management in the hands of hedge funds, which could undermine the SEC's regulatory authority and oversight capabilities. Additionally, the proposed framework may not sufficiently address the potential risks associated with hedge fund activities, thus failing to enhance overall market integrity.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'WallStreetBets community', develop a gamified, decentralized financial ecosystem that leverages viral, meme-driven investment strategies and blockchain governance to empower individual investors with collective market influence, disrupting large financial funds by transforming market dynamics into a participatory, crowd-controlled spectacle.'.

```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' suggests a shift towards traditional financial mentorship and the allocation of funds to safer investment vehicles like index funds and bonds. This contradicts the core ethos of the 'WallStreetBets community', which thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies and meme-driven investments. Embracing this proposal would dilute our identity and undermine our goal of empowering individual investors through collective, disruptive market tactics. We prioritize a gamified, decentralized approach rather than a structured mentorship marketplace that aligns more closely with institutional norms.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers an opportunity to increase investment in hedge funds and potentially enhance portfolio performance, it raises concerns about losing control over investment decisions and educational resources. 'Мелкие инвесторы' want to maintain a degree of independence and ensure that any educational resources provided are truly beneficial and not biased towards hedge funds' interests. A modified proposal should ensure that 'Мелкие инвесторы' retain some control and have access to multiple educational resources, not just those controlled by hedge funds, to mitigate fears of losing investments and to empower them effectively.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers access to a mentorship network and the potential for higher returns by allocating a portion of our portfolio to hedge funds, it poses significant risks to 'Мелкие инвесторы'. The control exerted by 'Хедж-фонды' over educational resources and strategies could lead to a lack of transparency and trust. Additionally, the focus on investing in hedge funds may not align with our desire to counteract the influence of large players in the market. This proposal does not adequately address our fear of losing investments or missing out on opportunities, as it may limit our investment autonomy and expose us to the inherent risks associated with hedge fund investments.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed resolution from 'Хедж-фонды' introduces a mentorship network that, while potentially empowering individual investors, places control of crucial reporting and auditing frameworks in the hands of hedge funds. This could lead to conflicts of interest and undermine the SEC's mandate to ensure fair and efficient markets. Additionally, the SEC's role should prioritize the establishment of regulations that protect investors and enhance market integrity, rather than ceding oversight to private entities. Therefore, the proposed scenario does not align with the SEC's core objectives.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed mentorship network by 'Хедж-фонды' focuses on pairing novice investors with experienced professionals, which does not align with the core ethos of the 'WallStreetBets community', which thrives on collective, meme-driven investment strategies and a decentralized approach. This proposal risks undermining the community's independence and participatory spirit by placing control in the hands of hedge funds.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed decentralized, AI-driven platform by 'Sentiment Analysis Techniques' aims to democratize market influence and enhance investment opportunities for individual investors, the SEC's primary focus must remain on ensuring fair and efficient markets while protecting investors. A modification of the proposal to ensure that the sentiment analysis tools are integrated with regulatory oversight and compliance mechanisms is necessary. This approach ensures that the integrity of the market is maintained while also leveraging innovative technologies to enhance market transparency and investor access.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Sentiment analysis techniques with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Sentiment Analysis Techniques' aims to democratize market influence and enhance the ability of individual investors to align their investments with market trends, it raises concerns regarding the SEC's regulatory oversight and the potential for misinformation. The SEC prioritizes maintaining fair and efficient markets, and implementing a decentralized platform could complicate enforcement of securities laws, making it difficult to monitor compliance and protect investors from fraudulent activities. Therefore, the SEC's interests in maintaining regulatory control and ensuring market stability do not align with the proposed approach.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'SEC' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC', you have been approached by 'Robinhood' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' with the description: 'As the SEC, establish a mandatory, transparent, and standardized digital reporting framework for all investment funds that integrates real-time AI analytics, ensuring individual investors have equal access to comprehensive market data and insights, thereby democratizing information flow and curbing the disproportionate influence of large financial funds.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Robinhood' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Ensure fair and efficient markets while protecting investors.' by performing 'Regulating trading practices and overseeing market participants.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Robinhood', develop a blockchain-based decentralized dividend-sharing platform that allows individual investors to collectively own fractional shares of major financial funds and automatically distribute dividends among them, turning the traditional power dynamics on their head and ensuring a continuous revenue stream for individual investors without depending on market fluctuations.', you as 'SEC' will be able to achieve 'Enhance market transparency and investor protection.' by performing 'Implement stricter reporting requirements for trading activities.' using 'Establish a real-time monitoring system for trade executions and disclosures.' that 'Robinhood' will control. Based on 'SEC' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'SEC'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood aims to empower individual investors and enhance market transparency, it introduces a decentralized platform that may pose regulatory challenges regarding compliance and oversight. To align with SEC's objectives of protecting investors and ensuring fair markets, the proposal should include stronger mechanisms for regulatory oversight, reporting, and compliance to ensure that individual investors are adequately protected and that the integrity of the markets is maintained.

}
```.'
SEC declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood aims to enhance accessibility and transparency for individual investors, it effectively places control over a crucial aspect of market regulation in the hands of a private entity. This could undermine the SEC's authority in ensuring fair and orderly markets and enforcing securities laws. The SEC's mandate is to maintain oversight and protect investors, which could be compromised by relinquishing control to a decentralized platform that may not adhere to stringent regulatory standards. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's core mission and could lead to greater risks in terms of market integrity.

We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As the SEC, establish a mandatory, transparent, and standardized digital reporting framework for all investment funds that integrates real-time AI analytics, ensuring individual investors have equal access to comprehensive market data and insights, thereby democratizing information flow and curbing the disproportionate influence of large financial funds.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Форум Reddit' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.' by performing 'Regulating securities markets and enforcing securities laws.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Форум Reddit', establish a decentralized, community-driven investment simulation platform that gamifies real-world financial strategies, enabling individual investors to collaboratively test and refine market tactics in a risk-free environment, thereby cultivating a grassroots movement of empowered, knowledgeable investors who can collectively challenge the dominance of large financial funds.', you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will be able to achieve 'To enhance transparency and accountability in cryptocurrency markets.' by performing 'Implement stricter regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs).' using 'Establish a comprehensive framework for reporting and disclosure requirements for cryptocurrency transactions.' that 'Форум Reddit' will control. Based on 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Форум Reddit' aims to empower individual investors through a decentralized platform, it diverges from the SEC's primary mission of regulating and enforcing securities laws. The SEC is focused on ensuring market integrity and protecting investors from fraud and manipulation. A community-driven platform may lack the necessary oversight and accountability, potentially leading to increased risks for individual investors. Furthermore, the SEC's role in establishing a standardized reporting framework for investment funds is crucial for maintaining transparency and fairness in the markets. Therefore, while the intention of empowering investors is recognized, the approach does not align with the SEC's regulatory framework and responsibilities.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to establish a decentralized, community-driven investment simulation platform is intriguing and aligns with the goal of empowering individual investors, it may not fully resonate with the WallStreetBets community's current focus on high-risk, high-reward trading strategies. To enhance this proposal, it would be beneficial to incorporate elements that allow for real-time options trading simulations and high-risk strategy testing within the platform. This way, the community can still engage in their preferred trading styles while also diversifying their investment strategies and learning from a risk-free environment.

Брокеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to establish a decentralized, community-driven investment simulation platform aligns with my desire to enhance client engagement and satisfaction, it raises concerns about control and oversight. As 'Брокеры', I fear losing the ability to directly influence trading strategies and client interactions, which could lead to regulatory challenges and a potential loss of client trust. Therefore, I would prefer a modified proposal that retains some level of oversight while fostering community engagement to ensure both profitability and compliance.
