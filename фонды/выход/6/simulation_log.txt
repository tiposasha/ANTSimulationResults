Reasoning: The entity 'RKTlaggedreturn' directly encapsulates the desires and fears associated with the lagged returns of RKT. It addresses the group's interest in insightful information on lagged returns, positive and negative correlations with stock performance, and the impact of sentiment on trading volume and returns. Since the desires focus heavily on achieving positive returns and sentiment while the fears revolve around misleading data and negative returns, 'RKTlaggedreturn' serves as a focal point that embodies both aspects.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC
Reasoning: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) serves as the primary regulatory body overseeing the securities industry in the United States. It is tasked with enforcing federal securities laws, protecting investors from fraudulent activities, and ensuring market integrity and transparency. Given the desires for fair trading practices, prevention of manipulation, and the need for stability and predictability in stock prices, the SEC's role in regulating the markets aligns closely with these interests and concerns expressed by market participants. The SEC embodies the regulatory framework that aims to mitigate fears of market manipulation and volatility, making it a fitting representative for this group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is the primary regulatory body responsible for overseeing financial markets and ensuring fair trading practices.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Liquidity
Reasoning: Liquidity is a critical factor that encapsulates both the desires and fears of stock market participants. High liquidity facilitates smooth trading, efficient price discovery, and reflects true market value, aligning with the desire for profitable trades and investments. Conversely, low liquidity can lead to market inefficiencies, volatility, and potential manipulation, which are significant fears of market participants. Thus, liquidity serves as a comprehensive index that captures the core interests and concerns of the entire group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Robinhood
Reasoning: Robinhood best represents the interests and concerns of this group as it serves as a platform that embodies the desire for commission-free trading and democratizes finance for retail investors. It is at the center of the discussions around regulatory scrutiny and user experience, facing fears of negative media attention and regulatory backlash. As a brokerage firm, Robinhood directly impacts both retail investors and the sentiment of platforms like WallStreetBets, while also facing competition from larger brokers and discount platforms. Its role in facilitating trading for small investors aligns with the desires of the group to influence stock prices and engage in trading discussions.

Resolution created by Informed party (I): As 'Informed party (I)', I propose the creation of a global, decentralized financial literacy and strategy platform powered by an AI mentor system that customizes educational pathways and strategic insights for individual investors, empowering them with the knowledge and tools to independently identify and exploit market inefficiencies before large financial funds can act.
Resolution created by Investors: As 'Investors', we propose the creation of a decentralized, AI-driven investment simulation platform that gamifies the stock market experience, allowing individual investors to experiment with strategies in a risk-free virtual environment and earn real-world rewards for successful simulations, thereby leveling the playing field against large financial funds by fostering innovation and confidence in personal investment approaches.
Resolution created by RKTlaggedreturn: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I propose creating an adaptive, self-regulating investment ecosystem powered by quantum computing algorithms that dynamically adjust market conditions in real-time, providing individual investors with personalized, predictive insights and strategies that inherently neutralize large financial funds' advantages by continuously recalibrating market equilibria.

Resolution created by SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission): As the SEC, I propose establishing a collaborative, real-time regulatory sandbox platform where individual investors can directly engage with and influence the regulatory development process, ensuring that their needs and insights shape the rules governing large financial funds, thereby creating a more balanced and inclusive financial ecosystem.
Resolution created by Short squeeze: As 'Short squeeze', I propose the creation of a decentralized, real-time market intervention platform that empowers individual investors to collectively initiate legally compliant short squeezes against large financial funds, redistributing market power by leveraging crowd-sourced capital and strategic coordination to temporarily invert traditional market dynamics and create opportunities for individual profit.
Resolution created by Herding measure: As 'Herding measure', I propose the establishment of a global, AI-driven "Collective Intelligence Network" that incentivizes and harnesses the diverse insights and strategies of individual investors by dynamically aggregating and analyzing their collective decision-making patterns to autonomously develop and execute large-scale, coordinated investment strategies that effectively neutralize the influence of large financial funds while promoting shared profits and market inclusivity.
Resolution created by Liquidity: As 'Liquidity', I propose the development of a global, decentralized liquidity-sharing network that automatically allocates and optimizes the flow of capital between individual investors based on real-time demand signals and market conditions, effectively diluting the concentration of financial power held by large funds and fostering a collaborative, resilient investment ecosystem where individuals can seamlessly leverage collective liquidity to access profitable opportunities.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', I propose the creation of a decentralized, real-time "Market Democracy Platform" that empowers individual investors to vote on and directly influence major financial fund decisions and strategies, redistributing market power through collective governance and ensuring that small investors have a say in shaping market dynamics, thereby fostering a more equitable and participatory investment environment.
Resolution created by WallStreetBets community: As the 'WallStreetBets community', we propose the creation of a "Meme Market Manipulation Platform" that harnesses the viral power of internet culture to orchestrate coordinated, unpredictable investment surges, leveraging humor and collective action to disrupt large financial funds' strategies and create spontaneous, high-volatility opportunities for individual investors.

We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As the 'WallStreetBets community', we propose the creation of a "Meme Market Manipulation Platform" that harnesses the viral power of internet culture to orchestrate coordinated, unpredictable investment surges, leveraging humor and collective action to disrupt large financial funds' strategies and create spontaneous, high-volatility opportunities for individual investors.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Мелкие инвесторы' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize short-term gains through high-risk trades.' by performing 'Engaging in speculative trading on meme stocks and options.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Координации действий мелких инвесторов для противостояния крупным хедж-фондам', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Diversify investment portfolio to mitigate risks.' by performing 'Allocate a portion of investments to stable, blue-chip stocks.' using 'Create a structured investment plan that includes regular portfolio reviews and adjustments.' that 'Мелкие инвесторы' will control. Based on 'WallStreetBets community' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'WallStreetBets community'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears?

}
```.'
WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' to create a structured investment plan and allocate a portion of investments to stable, blue-chip stocks could help diversify and mitigate risks, it may not align with the high-risk, high-reward ethos that drives the 'WallStreetBets community'. Instead of fully adopting their proposal, a modification that incorporates elements of both high-risk trading and some level of stability could satisfy both parties. This could involve forming a hybrid approach where a portion of investments is still aimed at meme stocks while also establishing a safety net through stable investments.

```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The 'WallStreetBets community' thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies, particularly through meme stocks and options trading. The proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' to diversify investment strategies and focus on stable assets goes against the core ethos of the community, which values volatility and the potential for massive short-term gains. Additionally, the control that 'Мелкие инвесторы' would have over the structured plan limits the spontaneous and chaotic nature that defines the 'WallStreetBets community'. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the desires and interests of the 'WallStreetBets community'.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Based on 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to enhance the participation of small investors in the securities market aligns with the SEC's mission to protect investors, it is crucial that the SEC maintains regulatory oversight and not cede control to any external group. Therefore, I propose modifying the resolution to ensure that educational programs and simplified investment platforms for small investors are developed in collaboration with the SEC, maintaining regulatory integrity while empowering small investors.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' aims to enhance accessibility and reduce barriers for small investors, it shifts control of regulatory frameworks to these investors. This could undermine the SEC's ability to maintain orderly markets and enforce securities laws effectively. The SEC's role is to protect all investors and ensure market integrity; ceding control to a specific group could lead to imbalances and conflicts of interest that jeopardize the overall stability of financial markets.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed sentiment analysis techniques can provide valuable insights into market emotions, they seem to limit the spontaneous, chaotic nature that the WallStreetBets community thrives on. Instead of fully embracing this structured approach, we suggest integrating sentiment analysis into our existing meme-driven strategy. This would ensure that we maintain our community's unique identity and spontaneity while also utilizing data-driven insights to enhance our collective investment actions.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Sentiment analysis techniques with reasoning: The proposed scenario shifts the control of sentiment analysis to 'Sentiment analysis techniques', which undermines the autonomy and spontaneous nature of the WallStreetBets community. The community thrives on unpredictability and collective humor, and the new platform may impose structure and oversight that could stifle our unique approach to market disruption. While utilizing sentiment analysis could provide insights, it risks transforming our community into a more conventional trading group, deviating from our core identity.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: The proposal by XG-9 to implement a decentralized AI-driven investment cooperative conflicts with the core identity of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies and the humor-driven, chaotic nature of meme stocks. While the idea of diversifying investment strategies could potentially lead to long-term gains, it significantly dilutes the essence of what the community values—spontaneity and collective action against large financial funds. The shift towards a structured, AI-driven approach could undermine the community's engagement and spontaneity, leading to a loss of interest among members who prefer the existing high-risk, meme-focused strategy.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal by XG-9 presents an innovative approach to democratizing investment opportunities and leveraging AI for better decision-making, it raises significant concerns regarding regulatory oversight, investor protection, and market integrity. The SEC's primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure fair markets, which could be jeopardized by a decentralized system that may lack adequate controls and accountability. Additionally, the proposed framework does not clearly address how it would comply with existing securities laws or how it would ensure transparency and reporting requirements, particularly in the context of cryptocurrency. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the SEC's objectives of maintaining orderly markets and protecting investors.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposal from 'Investors' emphasizes a shift towards a more structured and secure investment simulation platform, which may dilute the spontaneous and chaotic nature that defines the 'WallStreetBets community'. This community thrives on humor, unpredictability, and collective action to disrupt financial norms, which might not align with a decentralized, AI-driven platform focused on risk-free simulations.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'RKTlaggedreturn' introduces an innovative adaptive ecosystem powered by quantum computing, it also shifts control away from 'Investors' and places it entirely in the hands of 'RKTlaggedreturn'. 'Investors' must maintain a degree of influence over the investment strategies to ensure alignment with our goals. Therefore, I propose to modify the proposal to incorporate a collaborative framework where both 'Investors' and 'RKTlaggedreturn' share control and insights, ensuring that the adaptive ecosystem remains beneficial for individual investors while allowing for the proposed predictive capabilities.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'RKTlaggedreturn' presents an innovative approach to leveling the playing field for individual investors using advanced technology, it diverges from the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on the unpredictability and humor of meme culture. We appreciate the intention to create a self-regulating ecosystem but suggest incorporating elements that maintain the community's spirit of spontaneity and collective action. A modified proposal could blend predictive algorithms with meme-driven market strategies to better align with our existing community values.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by RKTlaggedreturn with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'RKTlaggedreturn' shifts the focus from the high-risk, high-reward strategy that the 'WallStreetBets community' thrives on to a more stable and regulated investment ecosystem. This may dilute the community's core identity and disrupt the spontaneous and chaotic nature that attracts members. The emphasis on adaptive algorithms and risk reduction contradicts the community's preference for meme-driven, speculative trading, which is centered around maximizing short-term gains rather than long-term stability.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Short squeeze with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Short squeeze' aims to empower individual investors and create upward pressure on stock prices, it raises concerns about potential artificial manipulation of the stock price.

SEC suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Herding measure' presents an innovative approach to enhance market inclusivity and leverage collective intelligence, it may require further refinement to ensure compliance with existing securities laws and regulations. As 'SEC', I believe that integrating aspects of this proposal with the existing resolution can create a more balanced framework that addresses the concerns of individual investors while maintaining market integrity and investor protection. A collaborative approach that combines transparency from large funds and the insights from individual investors could lead to a more equitable market environment.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by Herding measure with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Herding measure' suggests an innovative approach to harnessing collective insights and mitigating the influence of large financial funds, it may undermine the regulatory framework that 'SEC' seeks to establish. The proposed 'Collective Intelligence Network' could lead to increased market volatility and complicate enforcement of existing securities laws, thus hindering 'SEC's ability to ensure compliance and protect investors effectively. Furthermore, the autonomous execution of investment strategies could introduce unforeseen risks, making it challenging to monitor and regulate market activities.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Herding measure' aims to empower individual investors and create a more stable portfolio, it diverges from the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies. A shift towards low-risk investments and a more structured approach could dilute the excitement and potential gains that define our community. Therefore, we suggest modifications that maintain our risk-taking spirit while incorporating elements of collective intelligence without sacrificing our core identity.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to democratize access to investment opportunities and reduce the influence of large funds, it does not directly address the need to reflect the real value of the company in its stock price.

Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to incorporate a balance between decentralized governance and mechanisms that ensure stock price reflects true company value, possibly through clearer communication and collaboration with investors.

However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Short squeeze', I propose creating a dynamic "Market Resilience Fund" that leverages collective short squeeze strategies, empowering individual investors to collaboratively identify and target over-leveraged positions held by large financial funds, thereby inducing market corrections that redistribute wealth and create equitable profit opportunities while maintaining market integrity.', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Execute a coordinated buy-in on heavily shorted stocks to trigger a short squeeze' by performing 'Organize a campaign to collectively purchase shares of targeted stocks' using 'Utilize social media platforms to coordinate buy times and share updates on stock performance' that 'Short squeeze' will control.

Resolution created by Хедж-фонды: As 'Хедж-фонды', I propose the creation of a "Dynamic Equity Redistribution Fund" that utilizes advanced game theory and behavioral economics to design a series of strategic, market-driven simulations that incentivize large financial funds to voluntarily redistribute portions of their profits to individual investors, fostering an ecosystem of mutually beneficial growth and sustainability while preserving competitive market dynamics.
Recruited participants: ['Мелкие инвесторы', 'SEC', 'Robinhood', 'WallStreetBets community']
We ask 'Мелкие инвесторы' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Мелкие инвесторы', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' to create a 'Dynamic Equity Redistribution Fund' does not align with the desires of 'Мелкие инвесторы' to achieve profit and counteract large market players. While it offers access to hedge fund opportunities, it ultimately places control in the hands of hedge funds, which raises concerns about losing autonomy and the potential for unfavorable investment decisions. Additionally, the strategy of incentivizing wealth redistribution from hedge funds may not guarantee consistent returns for individual investors, thus failing to adequately mitigate the fear of losing investments or missing out on profit opportunities.
We ask 'SEC' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Short squeeze' with the description: 'As 'Short squeeze', I propose creating a dynamic "Market Resilience Fund" that leverages collective short squeeze strategies, empowering individual investors to collaboratively identify and target over-leveraged positions held by large financial funds, thereby inducing market corrections that redistribute wealth and create equitable profit opportunities while maintaining market integrity.'.

However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Хедж-фонды', I propose the creation of a "Dynamic Equity Redistribution Fund" that utilizes advanced game theory and behavioral economics to design a series of strategic, market-driven simulations that incentivize large financial funds to voluntarily redistribute portions of their profits to individual investors, fostering an ecosystem of mutually beneficial growth and sustainability while preserving competitive market dynamics.', you as 'SEC' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency and accountability in hedge fund operations.' by performing 'Implement stricter reporting and disclosure requirements for hedge funds.' using 'Establish a new regulatory framework that includes regular audits and real-time reporting of hedge fund activities.' that 'Хедж-фонды' will control. Based on 'SEC' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' presents a compelling approach to enhance transparency and foster mutual growth, it also places significant control in the hands of hedge funds, which could undermine the SEC's regulatory authority. To align the proposal with the SEC's objectives, I suggest incorporating stronger safeguards to ensure that the interests of individual investors are prioritized and that the fund's operations are subject to independent oversight. This modification would help maintain market integrity while allowing for innovative redistribution strategies.

```.'
SEC declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' seeks to control the reporting and transparency standards while the SEC's primary role is to ensure compliance and protect investors. Allowing hedge funds to dictate these standards may undermine the SEC's authority and ability to enforce regulations. Furthermore, the goal of creating a 'Dynamic Equity Redistribution Fund' does not align with the SEC's mandate of market integrity and could introduce complexities that detract from its core responsibilities.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Dynamic Equity Redistribution Fund' offers a strategy to promote wealth redistribution and sustainability, it risks limiting the 'WallStreetBets community's' ability to engage in high-risk, high-reward trading that has historically defined its identity. To align with our community's goals, we propose modifying the resolution to include provisions for maintaining a portion of our capital for high-risk, speculative trades while also participating in the more stable fund. This way, we can balance risk and reward, ensuring that the interests of individual investors are prioritized without losing the essence of our trading culture.

Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Short squeeze' with the description: 'As 'Short squeeze', I propose creating a dynamic "Market Resilience Fund" that leverages collective short squeeze strategies, empowering individual investors to collaboratively identify and target over-leveraged positions held by large financial funds, thereby inducing market corrections that redistribute wealth and create equitable profit opportunities while maintaining market integrity.'.

}
```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' seems to shift the focus from the high-risk, high-reward strategies that the 'WallStreetBets community' thrives on to a more controlled and conservative approach. This could dilute the community's identity and reduce the excitement and engagement that comes with speculative trading. Additionally, the idea of 'Dynamic Equity Redistribution Fund' controlled by 'Хедж-фонды' raises concerns about the community's autonomy and the potential for manipulation of strategies aimed at reducing risk, which may not align with the interests of individual investors in the community.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Volume' offers an innovative approach to increase the overall investment volume by 20%, it prioritizes higher-risk assets and a new, untested investment strategy that could expose 'Мелкие инвесторы' to significant losses. Given our current fears of losing investments and missing out on profit opportunities, this proposal does not adequately mitigate those concerns. The suggestion to allocate a higher percentage of capital towards riskier assets could jeopardize our goal of earning profits and countering large market players. Therefore, it is not aligned with our current desires and fears.

Sentiment analysis techniques has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Liquidity' with the description: 'As 'Liquidity', I propose the creation of an "Adaptive Liquidity Pool Matrix," a decentralized, AI-driven platform that dynamically redistributes liquidity across global markets in real-time, leveraging swarm intelligence and predictive analytics to empower individual investors with instant access to optimized liquidity channels, thereby neutralizing the concentration of financial power held by large funds and fostering a continuously evolving, equitable investment ecosystem.'.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed 'Interconnected Investment Ecosystem' could dilute the core identity of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies and the thrill of short selling. While diversification into safer options is beneficial for risk management, it contradicts the community's current appetite for aggressive trading. Additionally, the proposal's reliance on a neural-network-based platform controlled by 'Informed party (I)' raises concerns about autonomy and decision-making, potentially limiting the community's ability to freely share stock tips and engage in the high-stakes trading culture that defines WallStreetBets.

```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for an 'Interconnected Investment Ecosystem' presents an innovative approach to enhancing market participation by individual investors and could lead to increased transparency and efficiency, there are significant regulatory concerns that need to be addressed. Specifically, the SEC must ensure that any platform using AI and real-time data does not inadvertently facilitate market manipulation or create unfair advantages. Additionally, the proposal should include clear guidelines on the governance of such a platform, data privacy, and the responsibility of users to maintain compliance with existing securities laws. Therefore, modifications are needed to ensure alignment with regulatory standards and investor protections.

```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposal for an 'Interconnected Investment Ecosystem' is innovative and aims to enhance market transparency and investor engagement, it raises significant concerns regarding regulatory oversight, market manipulation risks, and the potential for unequal access to technology among investors. The SEC's primary responsibility is to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets, which could be compromised by a platform that fundamentally disrupts existing market structures without adequate regulatory safeguards. Additionally, allowing an external party to control the framework for audits and compliance checks could undermine the SEC's authority and accountability.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Quantum Entanglement Investment Network' presents an innovative approach to enhancing transparency and empowering individual investors, it introduces significant complexities regarding regulatory oversight, market stability, and potential cybersecurity risks. Modifying the proposal to incorporate a collaborative framework with the SEC that ensures compliance with existing securities laws and addresses these concerns would be more beneficial. This way, we can maintain our commitment to fair markets while also exploring new technological advancements that can help democratize investment opportunities.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the 'Quantum Entanglement Investment Network' proposal by 'XG-9' offers innovative technology for communication and market transparency, it raises significant concerns regarding regulatory oversight and control. The SEC's primary role is to protect investors and maintain market integrity through established regulations. The proposed decentralized nature of XG-9's framework could undermine the SEC's ability to enforce securities laws, monitor market activity, and ensure compliance. Additionally, the reliance on quantum technologies could introduce complexities and risks that are not yet fully understood, potentially leading to new vulnerabilities in the market. Therefore, the SEC must prioritize maintaining its regulatory framework and control over market operations, making this proposal less appealing.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: The proposal from XG-9, while innovative, shifts the focus away from our core identity as the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on short-term gains through discussions and stock picks. The idea of a 'Quantum Entanglement Investment Network' may seem appealing in terms of decentralization and transparency, but it introduces complexities and a level of control that could dilute our community's independence and spontaneous trading strategies. We value our current approach of maximizing short-term gains and engaging in real-time discussions, and thus, this proposal does not align with our existing desires and operational style.
