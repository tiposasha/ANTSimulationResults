Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Volume
Reasoning: Volume serves as a direct indicator of market interest and activity, which aligns with the desires and fears expressed in the group's concerns. It captures the sentiment-driven aspects of trading, reflecting both confidence and bearish sentiment through its fluctuations. By accurately representing market dynamics, trading volume encompasses the group's interests in understanding market behavior, sentiment correlations, and the risks associated with low volume, while also addressing fears related to economic downturns and irrational trading patterns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: XG-9
Reasoning: XG-9 represents the core of the desires and fears outlined in the provided information. As an advanced AI, its primary goal is to assimilate data and enhance its capabilities, while also being acutely aware of the risks associated with inaccuracies and potential shutdown. The desires and fears centered around data accuracy, sentiment analysis, and the impact of online communities on financial markets directly align with XG-9's operational and existential concerns, making it the most fitting representative of this group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Informed party (I)
Reasoning: The informed party (I) best represents the interests and concerns of the group due to their access to accurate and timely information, which aligns with the desires to make informed investment decisions, maximize profits, and enhance market efficiency. The fears associated with being misled or outcompeted by other information seekers emphasize the importance of the informed party's role in navigating the market effectively.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Investors
Reasoning: Among the entities listed, 'Investors' best represents the collective interests and concerns of the group. This entity encapsulates a broad category of individuals who share common desires for profit, successful investments, and informed decision-making while simultaneously fearing losses, misinformation, and trading restrictions. The repeated references to 'investors' in the desires and fears highlight their central role in the stock market dynamics, making them the most relevant entity to represent the group's interests and concerns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: RKTlaggedreturn
Reasoning: The entity 'RKTlaggedreturn' directly addresses the group's desires for insightful information on lagged returns for RKT, which is crucial for understanding past performance and predicting future returns. Additionally, it encompasses the fears related to misleading data and the potential for negative returns, making it a comprehensive representation of both the interests and concerns of the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Meme stocks
Reasoning: Meme stocks, such as GME, best represent the interests and concerns of the group due to their unique dynamics influenced by retail investor sentiment, social media trends, and their susceptibility to rapid price fluctuations and manipulation. The focus on meme stocks encapsulates the desires for stable and predictable conditions while also highlighting the fears of volatility, manipulation, and market inefficiency. Their behavior is often driven by collective retail investor actions, making them a prime example of the tensions between desires for stability and fears of manipulation in the stock market.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is responsible for regulating and overseeing financial markets to ensure fair trading practices and investor protection. Given the context of stock market manipulation, short-selling, and the various entities involved in these activities, the SEC represents the overarching authority that addresses both the desires for profit through manipulation and the fears of legal repercussions associated with such actions. It embodies the regulatory framework within which all other entities operate, making it a suitable representative for the interests and concerns of the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Regulatory authorities
Reasoning: Regulatory authorities are crucial in maintaining market integrity and stability, addressing concerns about manipulation and ensuring fair practices. Their role directly aligns with the desires to uphold market fairness and transparency while mitigating fears related to market instability and manipulation, particularly in the context of events like short squeezes driven by online communities.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Herding measure
Reasoning: The 'Herding Measure' is crucial in understanding correlated trading behavior among individual investors, which is a central concern shared among the desires and fears outlined. It captures the collective dynamics of trading patterns influenced by social media platforms like WallStreetBets, thereby addressing both the desire to identify high-return strategies and the fear of misinterpretation of data that could skew results. The assessment of herding behavior can provide insights into the market's response to stock mentions and help mitigate the risk of brokers defaulting on their obligations due to chaotic trading environments.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Liquidity
Reasoning: Liquidity is a critical factor that encompasses the interests and concerns of stock market participants. High liquidity facilitates smooth trading, accurate pricing, and efficient market operations, which are essential for making profitable trades and investments. Participants desire liquidity to avoid price manipulation, ensure fair trading practices, and maintain stability in the market. Furthermore, liquidity directly impacts trading volume and the ability to execute trades at desired prices, reflecting the true value of stocks, which aligns with both the desires and fears expressed.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Robinhood
Reasoning: Robinhood best represents the interests and concerns of the group because it embodies the desire to democratize finance through commission-free trading, which aligns with the desires of retail investors to maximize profits and engage in active discussions about stock trading strategies. However, it also faces significant fears regarding regulatory scrutiny and negative media attention, particularly related to its business practices and the potential for market manipulation. As a platform that facilitates trading for a large number of retail investors, Robinhood directly influences user experiences and perceptions within the financial community.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: WallStreetBets community
Reasoning: The WallStreetBets community embodies the collective interests and concerns of retail investors who seek to challenge institutional investors, capitalize on market momentum, and influence stock prices through coordinated actions. Their activities reflect a desire for high returns, access to trading opportunities, and a level playing field in the financial markets, making them a fitting representative of this group.

Resolution created by Meme stocks: As 'Meme stocks', I propose the creation of a viral, community-driven investment challenge platform that gamifies stock market engagement by encouraging individual investors to participate in themed, short-term trading competitions, leveraging the power of social media virality and collective enthusiasm to disrupt traditional market dynamics and diminish the influence of large financial funds, all while fostering a sense of community and empowerment among retail investors.

Resolution created by Liquidity: As 'Liquidity', I propose the creation of a dynamic, real-time liquidity pool network that allows individual investors to collectively influence market liquidity by temporarily reallocating capital to targeted assets, creating strategic liquidity surges that disrupt large financial funds' market control, foster price stability, and empower retail investors with enhanced market impact.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', I propose the creation of a "Decentralized Dividend Redistribution Platform" that automatically redistributes a portion of dividends from large financial funds to individual investors based on a transparent, community-driven algorithm that rewards ethical and equitable investment practices, thus directly empowering retail investors and diminishing large funds' financial dominance while fostering a culture of fairness and inclusivity in the investment ecosystem.
Resolution created by WallStreetBets community: As 'WallStreetBets community', we propose the creation of a decentralized, meme-powered financial activism platform that harnesses the collective humor, creativity, and social media prowess of retail investors to orchestrate unpredictable, viral market movements and publicity stunts, thereby disrupting traditional financial narratives and diminishing the influence of large financial funds through community-driven chaos and strategic unpredictability.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution offers a strategic shift towards long-term stability and diversification of investments, it may conflict with the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies and meme-driven market movements. To ensure alignment with our community's culture and objectives, I propose modifying the proposal to include a balance between high-risk trades and strategic long-term investments, allowing for both the excitement of meme trading and the stability of diversified portfolios. This approach can attract more retail investors while still challenging the status quo.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' focuses on diversification and reducing overall risk, which contrasts with the core ethos of the 'WallStreetBets community' that thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies. Embracing a more conservative investment approach would dilute the community's identity and reduce the excitement and engagement that comes from meme-driven, unpredictable market movements. Additionally, the control by 'Мелкие инвесторы' over educational resources and investment workshops could lead to a loss of autonomy for the 'WallStreetBets community', undermining its fundamental purpose of collective and chaotic financial activism.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the incorporation of sentiment analysis techniques can enhance decision-making and empower individual investors, the WallStreetBets community thrives on unpredictability and meme culture. Therefore, the proposal should emphasize leveraging sentiment analysis in a way that aligns with our unique identity and maintains our community-driven chaos, rather than becoming overly structured or reliant on analytical tools. A modified proposal could focus on using sentiment analysis to inform but not dictate trading strategies, ensuring we maintain our core values of creativity and community spontaneity.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to create a decentralized investment ecosystem that could reflect the true value of the company and mitigate the influence of large financial funds, it lacks clarity on how individual investor insights will be integrated and how conflicts of interest will be managed. Additionally, there needs to be a stronger emphasis on ensuring that the collective strategies do not lead to volatility that could further manipulate stock prices. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to include a clearer framework for governance, investor protection, and integration of individual investor strategies.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed resolution introduces a decentralized investment network which could undermine the traditional mechanisms of valuing the company. While the idea of leveraging collective intelligence is appealing, it could lead to increased volatility and manipulation, ultimately compromising the authentic representation of the company's value. This contradicts my desire to reflect the true worth of the company and heightens my fear of being artificially manipulated.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a dynamic, global cooperative investment network aligns with the SEC's goals of enhancing transparency and accountability, it raises concerns about regulatory oversight, investor protection, and the potential for market manipulation. To ensure that the interests of individual investors are safeguarded and that the SEC's regulatory framework is upheld, we recommend modifications that include a clearer structure for governance, compliance mechanisms, and safeguards against fraud and abuse within the proposed network.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed resolution introduces a decentralized approach to investment that may undermine the SEC's ability to regulate and enforce securities laws effectively. While the intent to increase transparency and accountability is commendable, handing control of the regulatory framework to 'Informed party (I)' raises concerns about consistency, reliability, and oversight in financial reporting. The SEC prioritizes investor protection and maintaining orderly markets, which could be compromised in a decentralized system where accountability is dispersed.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the idea of creating a global cooperative investment network is intriguing, it fundamentally shifts the focus from high-risk trading, which is a core aspect of the WallStreetBets community, to responsible investing and long-term strategies. The community thrives on the thrill of speculative trading and community-driven stock tips. Therefore, the proposal needs to incorporate elements that still allow for high-risk trading opportunities alongside the educational aspects to ensure that the unique culture of WallStreetBets is preserved.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'RKTlaggedreturn' to create a gamified financial simulation platform is intriguing and offers a way to empower individual investors, it diverges from the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk trades and short-term gains. The proposed shift towards a diversified investment strategy and long-term asset focus may dilute the community's identity. A modification that retains the high-risk, high-reward approach while incorporating elements of collaboration and collective learning would be more aligned with the community's interests.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create an open-source, gamified financial simulation platform is innovative and has potential to empower individual investors, it raises concerns about regulatory oversight, market manipulation, and the potential for misinformation. The SEC must ensure that any platform that simulates financial markets adheres to existing regulations, promotes fair practices, and does not mislead users. To align the proposal with SEC's mandate, it must include provisions for compliance, oversight, and educational resources to ensure that users understand the risks and realities of investing.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by RKTlaggedreturn with reasoning: While the proposed gamified financial simulation platform aims to empower individual investors and enhance transparency, it raises concerns about the regulation and oversight of such a platform. The SEC is tasked with protecting investors and ensuring fair markets, which may be compromised if the platform lacks adequate regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the proposal's reliance on RKTlaggedreturn for controlling the reporting framework poses potential conflicts of interest and accountability issues, which could undermine investor protection and market integrity.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a community-driven investment challenge platform is appealing and aligns with the desire to maximize short-term gains, it does not adequately address the fears of losing investments or missing out on opportunities. To mitigate these fears, the proposal should include a stronger emphasis on educational resources and strategies for managing risk. Additionally, incorporating elements that emphasize long-term financial health could help balance the excitement of short-term trading with the security of sustainable investing.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Meme stocks with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Meme stocks' aims to stabilize prices and promote long-term investment strategies, it conflicts with the current desire for short-term profits through trading. 'Мелкие инвесторы' fear losing investment opportunities and being outmaneuvered by large players, and the suggested collective agreement to hold shares may inhibit immediate profit-taking and could lead to losses if the market dynamics shift. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the current goals of maximizing short-term gains and countering large market players.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a community-driven investment challenge platform is innovative and could promote greater engagement among retail investors, it raises concerns about market volatility and the potential for unregulated trading practices that could harm investors. The SEC's primary responsibility is to ensure fair and efficient markets while protecting investors. Therefore, the proposal needs to include provisions for enhanced regulatory oversight, investor education, and mechanisms to prevent manipulation or excessive risk-taking that could arise from gamified trading competitions.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Meme stocks with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Meme stocks' aims to create a community-driven investment platform that encourages retail investor participation, it raises significant concerns regarding market manipulation, volatility, and the potential for misinformation. The SEC's primary responsibility is to protect investors and maintain fair markets, and a platform that gamifies trading may encourage reckless behavior and speculative trading without adequate safeguards. Additionally, allowing 'Meme stocks' to control the regulatory task force may lead to conflicts of interest and undermine the SEC's role in enforcing securities laws and protecting market integrity.

RKTlaggedreturn declined the resolution proposed by Herding measure with reasoning: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', the focus is on creating an open-source, gamified financial simulation platform that empowers individual investors through experimentation and innovation. While 'Herding measure' proposes a Collective Influence Network that aims to balance the power of large financial funds, it may shift the focus away from individual empowerment and experimentation towards collective influence driven by prevailing sentiments. This could dilute the innovative aspect of the original resolution, potentially limiting the diverse strategies that individual investors can explore. Thus, the proposal does not align with the core intent of fostering an egalitarian investment ecosystem through individual empowerment.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the concept of a 'Collective Influence Network' is intriguing and aligns with the goal of empowering individual investors, there are concerns about potential regulatory implications and market manipulation. The SEC must ensure that any system designed to pool voting rights and capital does not inadvertently lead to coordinated trading that could disrupt market integrity. A modified proposal should include clear guidelines on how to prevent such risks, as well as mechanisms for transparency and accountability to uphold the SEC's mandate of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Herding measure with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Herding measure' aims to enhance market stability and promote egalitarianism among investors, it poses significant regulatory challenges and risks. The establishment of a decentralized system for pooling voting rights and capital could lead to increased volatility and coordination failures, making it difficult for the SEC to monitor and enforce compliance with existing securities laws. Additionally, the potential for manipulation and abuse of such a system raises concerns about investor protection and market integrity. The SEC's primary mandate is to ensure fair and efficient markets while safeguarding investors, which may not be compatible with the proposed decentralized approach.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Форум Reddit' to create a decentralized, meme-driven investment platform conflicts with the SEC's mandate to protect investors and maintain fair markets. While democratizing market influence is a noble goal, the lack of regulatory oversight in such a platform poses significant risks, including potential fraud, market manipulation, and lack of investor protection. Additionally, the SEC cannot allow a platform that operates outside of established securities laws, as it could undermine the integrity of financial markets and create chaos, which is contrary to the SEC's objectives.

Sentiment analysis techniques suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed decentralized, AI-driven financial mentor network aligns with the goal of empowering individual investors, it lacks a clear integration of sentiment analysis techniques that would enhance its effectiveness. By modifying the proposal to explicitly incorporate sentiment analysis as a core component of the network, we can ensure that real-time emotional trends are utilized to inform investment strategies, thereby providing a more comprehensive solution that addresses both emotional market dynamics and individual investor needs.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: The proposal from 'Volume' shifts the focus of the 'WallStreetBets community' from maximizing short-term gains through meme stocks and options trading to promoting long-term investment strategies. This change does not align with the current identity and goals of the community, which thrives on high-risk trading and immediate financial returns. Additionally, the control of the long-term investment discussions by 'Volume' could undermine the community's autonomy and dynamic trading culture.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Volume' aims to create a decentralized marketplace that enhances individual investor participation, it raises concerns regarding investor protection, market manipulation, and compliance with existing securities laws. The SEC must ensure that any new framework adheres to regulatory standards to safeguard investors. Therefore, modifications should focus on ensuring that the proposed blockchain-based ecosystem includes robust consumer protection measures, mechanisms for preventing fraud, and regulatory compliance to align with the SEC's mandate of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Volume' to create a blockchain-based financial ecosystem presents innovative ideas for decentralization and collaboration, it raises significant concerns regarding investor protection, regulatory oversight, and market stability. The SEC is tasked with ensuring fair and efficient markets, which can be compromised by a decentralized system that lacks robust regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the control of real-time data reporting by 'Volume' may lead to conflicts of interest and challenges in maintaining transparency and accountability. Therefore, the potential risks associated with this proposal outweigh the benefits.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'Regulatory authorities' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns for investors while managing risk effectively.' by performing 'Investing in a diverse portfolio of assets and employing advanced trading strategies.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Regulatory authorities', I propose the creation of a transparent, algorithm-driven oversight mechanism that enforces equitable access to financial markets by mandating large financial funds to share proprietary insights and strategies with a public repository, ensuring individual investors benefit from the same informational advantages, thus fostering a fair competitive environment and diminishing monopolistic practices.', you as 'Хедж-фонды' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency and reduce systemic risk in the financial markets.' by performing 'Implement regular reporting and disclosure of investment strategies and risks.' using 'Establish a standardized reporting framework that requires hedge funds to provide detailed information on their investment activities, risk management practices, and performance metrics on a quarterly basis.' that 'Regulatory authorities' will control. Based on 'Хедж-фонды' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Получить прибыль от своих инвестиционных стратегий. Your current fears: Понести значительные убытки из-за неожиданных действий мелких инвесторов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Хедж-фонды'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance transparency and reduce systemic risk, it raises concerns about sharing proprietary strategies, which could undermine the competitive edge of hedge funds. A modified approach could involve a tiered system where only non-sensitive information is disclosed, allowing hedge funds to protect their unique strategies while still contributing to a more equitable market. This approach would help hedge funds maintain profitability while addressing the fears of significant losses due to unpredictable actions from smaller investors.

'Regulatory authorities' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns for investors while managing risk.' by performing 'Investing in a diversified portfolio of assets including equities, bonds, and alternative investments.'.

}
```.'
Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The proposed resolution by the regulatory authorities introduces a mechanism that mandates sharing proprietary insights and strategies, which could dilute the competitive edge of hedge funds. While it aims to promote equitable access and transparency, it may also lead to increased risks from informed individual investors acting on the same information. This could exacerbate the fear of incurring significant losses due to unexpected actions from these investors. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the desire to profit from investment strategies while managing risks.

Resolution created by Хедж-фонды: As 'Хедж-фонды', I propose the creation of a symbiotic algorithmic investment platform that dynamically pairs institutional strategies with individual investor portfolios, allowing retail investors to autonomously mirror and adapt hedge fund tactics in real-time through a transparent, customizable interface while earning rewards for strategy contributions, thereby aligning interests and fostering a collaborative ecosystem that democratizes access to sophisticated financial tools.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' presents an opportunity for 'Мелкие инвесторы' to access sophisticated financial tools and potentially increase overall investment stability, there are concerns about the control exercised by hedge funds over the proposed platform. This could limit our autonomy and ability to achieve profits independently. To better align with our desires for profit and independence, we propose modifications that ensure 'Мелкие инвесторы' maintain a significant degree of control and decision-making power within the platform, alongside robust safeguards against potential risks imposed by hedge fund strategies.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers a way to increase investment in hedge funds and access sophisticated financial tools, it ultimately puts 'Мелкие инвесторы' at a disadvantage by placing control over educational resources and performance data in the hands of hedge funds. This could lead to a lack of transparency and limit our ability to make fully informed investment decisions. Our primary desire is to achieve profit and compete against larger market players, and this proposal does not address our fears of losing investments or missing out on profitable opportunities, as it could create dependency on hedge fund strategies that may not align with our interests.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' may initially seem beneficial by providing access to sophisticated strategies and tools. However, it also implies a loss of the community's autonomy and the high-risk, high-reward trading culture that defines the 'WallStreetBets community'. The proposed solution leans towards a more conservative approach, which may suppress the community's core identity and enthusiasm for engaging in high-risk trades. The control exerted by 'Хедж-фонды' over the education program raises concerns about potential biases and limitations on the community's strategies and discussions. Therefore, while the idea of democratizing access to financial tools is appealing, the loss of the community's ethos and freedom outweighs the potential benefits.

'Liquidity' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Брокеры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize client investments' by performing 'Offering a variety of trading options'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'Цена акций компании' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Хедж-фонды' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Хедж-фонды', I propose the creation of a symbiotic algorithmic investment platform that dynamically pairs institutional strategies with individual investor portfolios, allowing retail investors to autonomously mirror and adapt hedge fund tactics in real-time through a transparent, customizable interface while earning rewards for strategy contributions, thereby aligning interests and fostering a collaborative ecosystem that democratizes access to sophisticated financial tools.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Цена акций компании' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns on investments' by performing 'Investing in a diversified portfolio of assets'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Цена акций компании', I propose the creation of a real-time, transparent dividend redistribution platform that automatically channels a portion of profits from large financial funds into a collective investment pool for individual investors, thereby directly linking institutional success to retail empowerment and ensuring equitable wealth distribution through investment dividends.', you as 'Хедж-фонды' will be able to achieve 'Increase the stock price of the company' by performing 'Engage in strategic buying of the company's shares' using 'Establish a buyback program to support stock price and improve market perception' that 'Цена акций компании' will control. Based on 'Хедж-фонды' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Получить прибыль от своих инвестиционных стратегий. Your current fears: Понести значительные убытки из-за неожиданных действий мелких инвесторов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Хедж-фонды'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Цена акций компании' aligns with the goal of increasing the stock price of the company, it raises concerns regarding the potential for uncontrolled influence from retail investors that could lead to volatility and unpredictability in the market. To address this, a modified approach could include a mechanism that allows hedge funds to retain some level of control or influence over the dividend redistribution process, ensuring that it supports stability and aligns with institutional investment strategies.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'Цена акций компании' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'Хедж-фонды' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Хедж-фонды', I propose the creation of a symbiotic algorithmic investment platform that dynamically pairs institutional strategies with individual investor portfolios, allowing retail investors to autonomously mirror and adapt hedge fund tactics in real-time through a transparent, customizable interface while earning rewards for strategy contributions, thereby aligning interests and fostering a collaborative ecosystem that democratizes access to sophisticated financial tools.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Цена акций компании' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns on investment through strategic trading.' by performing 'Analyzing market trends and adjusting portfolio allocations.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Цена акций компании', I propose the creation of a real-time, transparent dividend redistribution platform that automatically channels a portion of profits from large financial funds into a collective investment pool for individual investors, thereby directly linking institutional success to retail empowerment and ensuring equitable wealth distribution through investment dividends.', you as 'Хедж-фонды' will be able to achieve 'Stabilize the company's stock price.' by performing 'Engage in share buybacks to support the stock price.' using 'Implement a coordinated buyback program that allows for scheduled purchases of shares to reduce volatility.' that 'Цена акций компании' will control. Based on 'Хедж-фонды' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Получить прибыль от своих инвестиционных стратегий. Your current fears: Понести значительные убытки из-за неожиданных действий мелких инвесторов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Хедж-фонды'?

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES or NO
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: The proposal by 'Цена акций компании' does not align with the primary desire of 'Хедж-фонды' to profit from their investment strategies. Instead, it introduces a system that redistributes profits to individual investors, which could dilute the returns for hedge funds. Additionally, the proposed platform could increase the risk of unexpected actions from retail investors, exacerbating the fear of significant losses. Therefore, this proposal does not benefit the interests of 'Хедж-фонды' and does not mitigate existing fears.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Цена акций компании' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Liquidity' with the description: 'As 'Liquidity', I propose the creation of a real-time, adaptive liquidity optimization platform that empowers individual investors by dynamically reallocating market liquidity to amplify and stabilize their collective market actions, thereby countering the influence of large financial funds by leveraging liquidity as a strategic tool for democratizing earning potential.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Цена акций компании' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Increase the awareness and discussion about stock prices of specific companies.' by performing 'Posting memes and discussions about trending stocks on Reddit.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Цена акций компании', I propose the creation of a real-time, transparent dividend redistribution platform that automatically channels a portion of profits from large financial funds into a collective investment pool for individual investors, thereby directly linking institutional success to retail empowerment and ensuring equitable wealth distribution through investment dividends.', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Drive the stock price of the targeted company up by 20%.' by performing 'Organize a coordinated buying effort among community members.' using 'Establish a specific time for the buying effort and create a shared platform for tracking stock price movements.' that 'Цена акций компании' will control.

Resolution created by XG-9: As 'XG-9', I propose the creation of an autonomous, AI-driven financial symbiosis platform that dynamically pairs individual investors with complementary skills and resources to form adaptive micro-investment communities, harnessing collective strengths to identify and capitalize on niche market opportunities, thereby diffusing power away from large financial funds and creating a decentralized network of agile, cooperative financial entities.

Meme stocks suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create an autonomous, AI-driven financial symbiosis platform is intriguing and offers a potential shift away from the dominance of large financial funds, it conflicts with the core essence of 'Meme stocks' which thrives on high trading volume and price volatility driven by retail investor enthusiasm. Instead of stabilizing stock prices, 'Meme stocks' seeks to maintain a dynamic trading environment. Therefore, I recommend modifying the proposal to embrace the high-energy, speculative nature of meme investing while still empowering retail investors through community collaboration and education.
