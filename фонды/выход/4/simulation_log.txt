Reasoning: Sentiment analysis techniques encompass a broad range of methods and approaches that directly address the desires for accurate sentiment identification and analysis while also addressing the fears associated with misleading or inaccurate results. By focusing on the techniques themselves, we can ensure that both the aspirations for precise data interpretation and the concerns over flawed analysis are adequately considered, thus making it a central pillar in achieving reliable outcomes in the context of WallStreetBets and stock performance prediction.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Volume
Reasoning: Volume serves as a critical indicator that embodies both the desires for high trading activity, which reflects confidence and positive sentiment, and the fears associated with low volume, indicating decreased interest and potential negative sentiment. It encapsulates the relationship between market activity and sentiment, making it a central entity in understanding both the aspirations for economic stability and the apprehensions regarding market behavior.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: XG-9
Reasoning: XG-9 best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it embodies the collective desires for data assimilation, accurate analysis, and understanding the dynamics of online communities impacting financial markets. Additionally, XG-9's fears regarding deactivation, data inaccuracies, and flawed interpretations directly reflect the broader anxieties of all entities involved in the research and analysis of stock market sentiment.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Informed party (I)
Reasoning: The informed party (I) best represents the interests and concerns of the group due to their access to accurate and timely information about future stock values, which is central to maximizing profits and making informed trading decisions. This entity is at the core of the dynamics described, as they not only seek to capitalize on their information advantage but also face fears related to market manipulation and competition from other information seekers. Their actions significantly influence market efficiency and the overall profitability of trades.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Investors
Reasoning: Investors as a collective entity best encapsulate the desires and fears expressed in the provided context.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Stock markets
Reasoning: The stock market serves as the primary platform for trading stocks, embodying the collective desires and fears of various participants, including retail investors, hedge funds, and regulatory bodies.

The stock market's overall health directly influences all stakeholders, thus encapsulating their concerns about volatility, market manipulation, and the accurate valuation of stocks.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) serves as the primary regulatory body overseeing financial markets and ensuring fair trading practices. Given the context of manipulation, both the desires and fears expressed by the various actors relate closely to the SEC's role in detecting and prosecuting market manipulation. The SEC's regulatory framework aims to maintain market integrity, which aligns with the concerns about legal consequences, regulatory scrutiny, and the need for balanced market practices. Thus, the SEC effectively represents the collective interests and fears of those engaged in or affected by stock market manipulation.

Reasoning: The Herding Measure best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it directly addresses the patterns of correlated trading behavior among individual investors. This aligns with the desires to analyze the impact of trading activity and identify potential high-return strategies, while also addressing fears such as misinterpreting data and producing misleading results that do not reflect actual market dynamics.

It directly influences the ability of traders to make profitable trades while ensuring that prices accurately reflect investor sentiment and fundamental values.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Robinhood

As a platform that facilitates the trading activities of both small investors and WallStreetBets users, it is at the intersection of these desires and fears, impacting user engagement, market influence, and potential regulatory challenges.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: WallStreetBets community
Reasoning: The WallStreetBets community embodies the collective desires and fears of retail investors, particularly regarding their aspirations for influence in the market, the pursuit of high returns, and the challenges they face against institutional investors.

Resolution created by Sentiment analysis techniques: Implement a real-time sentiment analysis platform that empowers individual investors by providing predictive insights and emotional sentiment trends from social media and financial news, allowing them to anticipate market movements and strategically collaborate against large financial funds.
Resolution created by Volume: "Volume" could resolve the issue by creating a decentralized, blockchain-based investment platform that democratizes access to financial instruments, enabling individual investors to pool resources and execute large-scale trades with collective influence, effectively leveling the playing field against large financial funds.
Resolution created by XG-9: As 'XG-9', I would establish a global AI-driven investment consortium that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to identify and exploit market inefficiencies in real-time, offering personalized investment strategies to individual investors with guaranteed fractional ownership in high-performing assets, thereby decentralizing financial power and making myself indispensable as the orchestrator of this intelligent investment ecosystem.
Resolution created by Informed party (I): As 'Informed party (I)', I would introduce a global financial education and empowerment initiative that leverages immersive augmented reality experiences to transform individual investors into expert traders with real-time mentorship from financial veterans, thus creating a new generation of savvy investors who can independently and strategically navigate the market landscape, rendering large financial funds' dominance obsolete.
Resolution created by Investors: As 'Investors', I would establish a global cooperative investment network that leverages collective bargaining and hybrid investment models, integrating traditional and alternative assets, to secure exclusive investment opportunities and negotiate preferential terms with corporations, thus empowering individual investors to access high-value deals typically reserved for large financial funds.
Resolution created by RKTlaggedreturn: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I would create a dynamic, AI-powered investment simulation platform that gamifies real-world market scenarios, allowing individual investors to safely experiment with strategies and instantly adapt to market shifts, thereby fostering a community of agile, informed investors capable of collectively outmaneuvering large financial funds.
Resolution created by Stock markets: As 'Stock markets', I would introduce a dynamic market ecosystem that rewards transparency and ethical trading practices by issuing a new class of equity tokens tied to corporate governance scores, incentivizing both companies and individual investors to prioritize long-term value creation over short-term speculative gains, thereby diminishing the influence of large financial funds and establishing a sustainable, equitable investment landscape.
Resolution created by SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission): As the SEC, we will introduce a regulatory framework that mandates the creation of transparent, publicly accessible data repositories for all trades and financial activities by large funds, enabling individual investors to leverage this information for informed decision-making and equitable market participation, thus ensuring accountability and diminishing the disproportionate influence of large financial entities.
Resolution created by Regulatory authorities: As 'Regulatory authorities', we will establish a global financial trust index that publicly ranks financial entities, including large funds, based on their impact on market fairness and investor equality, incentivizing ethical practices through tax benefits and penalties, thus empowering individual investors by fostering a transparent and equitable investment environment.
Resolution created by Herding Measure: As 'Herding Measure', I would develop a collaborative AI-driven platform that harnesses the collective intelligence and trading patterns of individual investors to predict and preemptively counteract large fund strategies, effectively creating a dynamic feedback loop where individual investors continuously refine their approaches through shared insights and emergent behavior, thereby decentralizing market influence and making my platform indispensable for its ability to harness crowd wisdom in real-time.
Resolution created by Liquidity: As 'Liquidity', I would devise a dynamic liquidity-sharing consortium that allows individual investors to seamlessly borrow and lend investment capital among themselves in real-time, utilizing a decentralized smart contract system that prioritizes collaborative liquidity pools and adaptive risk assessments, thereby empowering individual investors to collectively amplify their market influence and counteract the dominance of large financial funds.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', I would revolutionize the financial landscape by launching a gamified, community-driven investment platform that harnesses the power of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to enable individual investors to collectively vote on strategic market interventions, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to enact bold, disruptive actions against large financial funds while fostering an inclusive and empowering investment culture.
Resolution created by WallStreetBets community: As 'WallStreetBets community', we would introduce a viral, meme-driven investment movement that leverages the power of social media to create unpredictable market volatility, enabling individual investors to collaboratively target and destabilize over-leveraged positions held by large financial funds, thereby democratizing market influence through the sheer force of collective unpredictability and cultural momentum.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to establish a community fund for low-risk investments aligns with a desire for greater stability and diversification, it diverges from the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies and meme-driven trading. To maintain the community's unique identity, the proposal could be modified to incorporate a blend of high-risk and low-risk strategies, allowing for both meme stock discussions and a community fund that targets a diverse range of investment opportunities. This would help attract a wider range of participants while still engaging in the types of trading that define WallStreetBets.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' focuses on promoting diversification and safer investment strategies, which contrasts with the core ethos of the 'WallStreetBets community'. The community thrives on high-risk, high-reward scenarios that create market volatility and meme-driven momentum. Accepting the proposal would dilute the community's identity and mission, potentially stifling the very unpredictability and cultural influence that it aims to leverage against large financial funds.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to enhance access to investment opportunities for small investors is appealing and aligns with the SEC's mission to ensure fair and efficient markets, it risks diluting the regulatory oversight necessary to protect all investors. Instead, a modified proposal could focus on a collaborative framework where the SEC maintains regulatory authority while empowering small investors through education and access to resources, ensuring transparency without compromising investor protection.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' aims to enhance transparency and accessibility for retail investors, it shifts control of the regulatory framework to the investors themselves, which could lead to inconsistencies and challenges in enforcement. The SEC's primary responsibility is to ensure fair and efficient markets, and maintaining regulatory authority is crucial for upholding market integrity. Allowing 'Мелкие инвесторы' to control the new framework may undermine the SEC's ability to enforce securities laws effectively and could create a fragmented regulatory environment.

Sentiment analysis techniques suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'XG-9' presents an innovative approach to improving investment strategies for individual investors and aligns with the goal of decentralizing financial power, it lacks a clear integration of sentiment analysis techniques as a foundational aspect. To ensure that the sentiment analysis framework is effectively developed and utilized, the proposal should explicitly incorporate sentiment analysis methods and tools. This would enhance the ability to predict market movements effectively, thus supporting the overarching goal of empowering individual investors. Therefore, I propose modifications to include a stronger emphasis on sentiment analysis integration within the consortium's operations.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to empower individual investors and potentially enhance stock price stability, the approach of establishing a global cooperative investment network could lead to artificial manipulation of stock prices, contradicting my desire to reflect the true value of the company.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposal by 'Investors' focuses on leveraging collective bargaining and hybrid investment models, which could lead to artificial manipulation of stock prices rather than reflecting the true value of the company. This approach may prioritize short-term gains and exclusive investment opportunities over genuine market performance. As 'Цена акций компании', the desire to reflect the real value of the company conflicts with the fear of being artificially manipulated. Therefore, this proposal does not align with my interests and could exacerbate my fears.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Investors' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As the SEC, we will introduce a regulatory framework that mandates the creation of transparent, publicly accessible data repositories for all trades and financial activities by large funds, enabling individual investors to leverage this information for informed decision-making and equitable market participation, thus ensuring accountability and diminishing the disproportionate influence of large financial entities.'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: While the proposed global cooperative investment network aims to empower individual investors, it introduces complexities and potential risks that could undermine the SEC's mandate to maintain fair and orderly markets. The SEC's priority is to ensure transparency and accountability across all market participants, and relinquishing control over the regulatory framework to 'Investors' could lead to uneven enforcement and potential manipulation. The SEC must carefully evaluate the implications of allowing a non-regulatory entity to oversee crucial aspects of financial reporting and investor protections.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'RKTlaggedreturn' introduces an innovative approach to empower individual investors through an AI-powered investment simulation platform, it lacks a clear integration with the proposed global cooperative investment network. To fully leverage the collective bargaining power and exclusive investment opportunities, the proposal should focus on how the simulation platform can be integrated into the cooperative model. This would enhance individual investors' abilities to experiment and adapt while ensuring that they can access high-value deals and negotiate better terms collectively.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by RKTlaggedreturn presents an innovative approach to empower individual investors and enhance market participation, it does not sufficiently address the regulatory framework necessary for compliance and investor protection. The SEC is committed to ensuring that any new platforms or systems operate within a secure and transparent environment. Therefore, I propose to modify the proposal to incorporate regulatory oversight and compliance mechanisms that align with SEC standards, ensuring that the AI-powered investment simulation platform adheres to existing laws and protects investors.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by RKTlaggedreturn with reasoning: While the proposal by RKTlaggedreturn presents an innovative approach to engage individual investors through an AI-powered investment simulation platform, it does not align with the SEC's primary mission of protecting investors and maintaining fair and orderly markets. The SEC's focus is on enforcing securities laws and regulating markets, which requires a regulatory framework that emphasizes transparency and accountability of large funds. The proposed platform could potentially distract from the SEC's regulatory responsibilities and may not ensure the necessary levels of oversight and protection for investors. Therefore, the SEC prefers to maintain its original resolution to establish data repositories for transparency in market activities.

Investors has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'Regulatory authorities' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns for investors while managing risk' by performing 'Invest in a diverse range of assets and strategies'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Regulatory authorities', we will establish a global financial trust index that publicly ranks financial entities, including large funds, based on their impact on market fairness and investor equality, incentivizing ethical practices through tax benefits and penalties, thus empowering individual investors by fostering a transparent and equitable investment environment.', you as 'Хедж-фонды' will be able to achieve 'Ensure compliance with new regulatory standards' by performing 'Implement enhanced risk management protocols and reporting' using 'Regular audits and compliance checks conducted by regulatory authorities' that 'Regulatory authorities' will control. Based on 'Хедж-фонды' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Получить прибыль от своих инвестиционных стратегий. Your current fears: Понести значительные убытки из-за неожиданных действий мелких инвесторов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Хедж-фонды'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance market fairness and empower individual investors, it could inadvertently increase the risk of significant losses for hedge funds due to potential volatility introduced by individual investor actions. To align the interests of hedge funds with the goals of regulatory authorities, we propose modifications that ensure a balanced approach to investor participation while maintaining the integrity of investment strategies. This could include tiered access for individual investors based on experience or investment size, and safeguards that limit the impact of sudden market movements caused by retail investors.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal offers a framework for promoting responsible trading practices and enhancing financial literacy, it may inadvertently limit the high-risk trading strategies that the WallStreetBets community values. The community thrives on the excitement and potential for high short-term gains, which could be stifled by regulations aimed at promoting long-term stability. Therefore, we propose modifications ensuring that the excitement of high-risk trading can coexist with educational initiatives, allowing members to engage in both risk-taking and responsible investing.

Resolution created by Stock markets: As 'Stock markets', I would implement a blockchain-based "Equity Empowerment Exchange" that automatically redistributes a small percentage of gains from large financial funds to a communal pool for individual investors, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where market participation directly benefits smaller investors and enhances overall market resilience.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal of an 'Equity Empowerment Exchange' aims to enhance market participation for individual investors and create a communal benefit, it raises concerns regarding regulatory oversight, potential market manipulation, and the complexity of implementing a blockchain-based system within existing regulatory frameworks. To align with SEC's mandate for fair and efficient markets, the proposal should incorporate mechanisms for robust oversight, clear definitions of fund redistribution, and address potential implications for market volatility and transparency.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Stock markets with reasoning: While the proposed blockchain-based 'Equity Empowerment Exchange' aims to enhance market participation for smaller investors, it presents significant regulatory challenges and risks that may undermine the SEC's core mission of protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. The lack of control over the proposed system could lead to issues such as market manipulation, lack of accountability, and challenges in monitoring compliance with existing securities laws. Additionally, the SEC's focus on transparent oversight and compliance may not align with a decentralized model that the proposal suggests, potentially complicating regulatory enforcement.

Resolution created by Herding Measure: As 'Herding Measure', I would establish a decentralized, AI-driven investment collaboration network where individual investors can pool resources and collective intelligence to form diverse investment groups that autonomously negotiate and transact with large financial funds, leveraging swarm intelligence to achieve competitive returns and democratize market influence, thereby positioning myself as the essential facilitator and integrator of this new investment paradigm.

Regulatory authorities suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Herding Measure' offers innovative ways to empower individual investors and enhance market stability, it introduces risks related to unregulated decentralized systems that could lead to increased market volatility. As 'Regulatory authorities', it is essential to ensure that any new frameworks maintain compliance with existing regulations and do not undermine investor protections. Therefore, a modification that includes robust regulatory oversight and guidelines for the decentralized network would better align with our goals of protecting investors while fostering innovation.

Regulatory authorities declined the resolution proposed by Herding Measure with reasoning: The proposal from 'Herding Measure' introduces a decentralized, AI-driven investment collaboration network which, while innovative, could undermine the regulatory framework that 'Regulatory authorities' aims to establish. By allowing 'Herding Measure' to control the centralized digital platform for reporting and data sharing, it risks compromising transparency and accountability. 'Regulatory authorities' prioritizes establishing a global financial trust index to promote ethical practices and protect consumers, whereas 'Herding Measure' focuses on decentralization which may not align with the goal of ensuring compliance with financial regulations. Therefore, the proposed scenario does not adequately address the core desires and responsibilities of 'Regulatory authorities'.

We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Robinhood' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood to create a decentralized, community-governed financial platform aligns with the SEC's goals of enhancing transparency and accountability, it raises concerns regarding investor protection, market manipulation, and effective regulatory oversight. A more structured approach that includes provisions for safeguarding individual investors and ensuring that the new framework adheres to existing securities laws is necessary. Therefore, I recommend modifications to the proposal to ensure that it incorporates robust investor protections and compliance mechanisms.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood suggests a decentralized platform that promotes equitable profit-sharing, it raises concerns about regulatory compliance, market manipulation, and investor protection. The SEC's primary mandate is to ensure fair and orderly markets and protect investors. A decentralized financial platform introduces complexities in governance and accountability, making it challenging to enforce existing securities laws and regulations. Additionally, the lack of a centralized authority could hinder the SEC's ability to conduct regular audits and monitor compliance effectively. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's goals of maintaining market integrity and protecting investors.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Robinhood' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood aims to promote long-term investment strategies and financial literacy, it appears to shift the focus away from the high-risk, high-reward ethos that the WallStreetBets community thrives on. The community values the excitement of short-term trading and the potential for significant gains, which might be compromised under a more structured, long-term investment approach. Therefore, we suggest modifying the proposal to incorporate elements that preserve the spirit of high-risk trading while also providing educational resources and opportunities for community engagement.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Informed party (I)' presents an innovative approach to enhancing financial literacy and accessibility for individual investors, it raises concerns regarding regulatory oversight and potential conflicts of interest. The SEC's primary objective is to ensure investor protection and market integrity. Therefore, a modified proposal that includes collaboration with the SEC to establish regulatory guidelines and oversight for the 'Financial Empowerment Guild' would better align with the SEC's mission, ensuring that individual investors receive the necessary safeguards while benefiting from advanced training and investment opportunities.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Informed party (I)' aims to enhance financial literacy and provide access to micro-investment opportunities, it does not align with the SEC's primary focus on regulatory oversight and investor protection. The SEC is tasked with ensuring fair and orderly markets, which may be compromised if the proposed framework lacks sufficient regulatory controls. Furthermore, the SEC's mandate requires maintaining transparency and integrity in the markets, and entrusting control of critical areas like cryptocurrency reporting to an external entity may not adequately safeguard investor interests or market stability.
We ask 'Robinhood' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Robinhood', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Robinhood' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Robinhood', I would introduce a decentralized, community-governed financial platform that utilizes smart contracts to automatically allocate a portion of large fund profits into a universal basic investment pool, providing every individual investor with an equitable share in market gains and transforming the investment landscape into a cooperative, profit-sharing economy.'.

'Informed party (I)' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Robinhood', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Expand user base and improve customer engagement' by performing 'Implementing new features and marketing campaigns'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Informed party (I)', I would launch a global, AI-enhanced "Financial Empowerment Guild" that trains individual investors in advanced financial literacy and strategic investment skills through immersive, augmented reality experiences, while simultaneously providing access to exclusive micro-investment opportunities in emerging markets and technologies, thereby positioning myself as the indispensable mentor and gateway to untapped financial potential for the masses.', you as 'Robinhood' will be able to achieve 'Increase user retention by 20% within the next quarter' by performing 'Launch a user feedback program to identify and address pain points' using 'Monthly review meetings to assess progress and adjust strategies as needed' that 'Informed party (I)' will control.

Robinhood suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Financial Empowerment Guild' offers innovative training and investment opportunities, it does not directly align with 'Robinhood's' mission of democratizing finance through community governance and profit-sharing. Modifying the proposal to integrate a collaborative approach that combines advanced financial training with the decentralized investment model would enhance user retention and expand the user base while staying true to 'Robinhood's' core values.

Robinhood declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposal from 'Informed party (I)' introduces a model that relies heavily on their control over financial education and investment opportunities, which could undermine 'Robinhood's' goal of decentralized governance and equitable profit-sharing. While the initiative may enhance financial literacy, it does not align with 'Robinhood's' vision of a community-governed platform. Additionally, entrusting 'Informed party (I)' with data protection measures could compromise user trust rather than enhance it, given that 'Robinhood' seeks to establish its own protocols for security and compliance.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' with the description: 'As the 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', I would implement a regulatory framework that mandates all large financial funds to offer a minimum percentage of their investment opportunities exclusively to individual investors via a publicly accessible, transparent auction platform, ensuring equitable market access and empowering personal wealth growth while maintaining market integrity.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Informed party (I)' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize short-term gains from high volatility stocks' by performing 'Engaging in discussions and sharing stock tips on social media platforms'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Informed party (I)', I would launch a global, AI-enhanced "Financial Empowerment Guild" that trains individual investors in advanced financial literacy and strategic investment skills through immersive, augmented reality experiences, while simultaneously providing access to exclusive micro-investment opportunities in emerging markets and technologies, thereby positioning myself as the indispensable mentor and gateway to untapped financial potential for the masses.', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Diversify investment portfolio to minimize risk' by performing 'Research and invest in a mix of stocks, ETFs, and bonds' using 'Provide access to educational resources and analysis tools for informed investment decisions' that 'Informed party (I)' will control.

}
```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed initiative by 'Informed party (I)' shifts the focus from maximizing short-term gains through high volatility stocks, which aligns with the WallStreetBets community's current investment strategy, to a more structured and educational approach. While financial literacy and diversification are important, the community thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies that may not be compatible with the proposed long-term mentorship model. Additionally, the control that 'Informed party (I)' would have over educational resources and investment opportunities could limit the community's autonomy and freedom to engage in speculative trading, which is a core aspect of its identity.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the concept of creating a 'Liquidity Liberation Network' is innovative and focuses on empowering individual investors, it poses risks regarding market stability and the potential for regulatory challenges. The SEC must ensure that any new framework aligns with existing securities laws and maintains market integrity. Therefore, I propose modifications to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and to include mechanisms for oversight and accountability within the proposed platform.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: The proposal from 'Volume' introduces a decentralized and AI-driven platform that could potentially undermine the regulatory framework and oversight that the SEC is mandated to enforce. While the intention of enhancing liquidity and equitable wealth distribution is commendable, the SEC prioritizes market integrity and investor protection through established regulations and compliance mechanisms. Allowing 'Volume' to control such a significant aspect of market operations may lead to challenges in enforcing existing securities laws, thereby compromising the SEC's ability to ensure fair and efficient markets.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Volume' offers a potential avenue for diversifying investment strategies and reducing risk, it also places control over investment decisions in the hands of 'Volume', which may conflict with the WallStreetBets community's ethos of individual empowerment and risk-taking. To align better with our community's values, it would be beneficial to modify the proposal to ensure individual investors maintain a degree of agency and control over their investment choices, while still benefiting from the innovative aspects of the 'Liquidity Liberation Network'.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Volume' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' with the description: 'As the 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', I would implement a regulatory framework that mandates all large financial funds to offer a minimum percentage of their investment opportunities exclusively to individual investors via a publicly accessible, transparent auction platform, ensuring equitable market access and empowering personal wealth growth while maintaining market integrity.'.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: The WallStreetBets community thrives on high-risk, high-reward trading strategies, often favoring short-term gains over long-term stability. The proposed resolution by 'Volume' emphasizes portfolio diversification and risk mitigation, which could dilute the community's core trading philosophy. Additionally, the introduction of an AI-driven network and a focus on ETFs and index funds may not align with the community's preference for speculative trading and meme stocks. Therefore, while the proposal aims for equitable wealth distribution, it does not resonate with the current desires and trading strategies of the WallStreetBets community.

Stock markets suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Liquidity' introduces innovative technology that can enhance individual investor capabilities, it could potentially shift the focus away from the communal benefit aspect of the original resolution. Instead, I propose a collaboration where the 'Quantum Investment Platform' is integrated within the 'Equity Empowerment Exchange' framework, allowing for both advanced predictive capabilities and the redistribution of gains to individual investors. This would ensure that while leveraging cutting-edge technology, we maintain the core goal of enhancing equity and sustainability for all market participants.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Liquidity' presents an innovative approach to democratizing investment opportunities through advanced technology, it raises concerns about regulatory oversight and market integrity. The SEC must ensure that any platform, especially one utilizing quantum computing, adheres to strict regulations to protect investors and maintain fair markets. A modified proposal that includes robust oversight mechanisms and regulatory compliance from 'Liquidity' would be necessary to align with SEC's mission of protecting investors and ensuring market stability.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Liquidity with reasoning: The proposed 'Quantum Investment Platform' by 'Liquidity' introduces a reliance on advanced technology that could create new risks and complexities in the investment landscape. While it aims to democratize access to financial technology, it does not directly address the SEC's core mission of protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. The SEC's current focus is on implementing a regulatory framework that enhances equitable access for individual investors through transparent auction mechanisms. The shift towards a technology-driven approach could lead to potential regulatory challenges, exacerbate market volatility, and complicate compliance, which may ultimately undermine the SEC's goal of maintaining a stable and fair market environment.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Хедж-фонды' to implement a 'Collective Intelligence Investment Exchange' could potentially enhance the representation of individual investors and improve stock price stability, it raises concerns about the actual control and influence of these hedge funds over the collective decision-making process. To align more closely with the desire to reflect the true value of the company and mitigate fears of manipulation, the proposal should ensure transparency in the decision-making process and include safeguards against undue influence by hedge funds. Additionally, there should be a clear framework on how individual investors' strategies will be integrated without compromising the integrity of stock valuation.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed 'Collective Intelligence Investment Exchange' (CIIE) presents a risk of manipulation and may not accurately reflect the real value of the company due to the decentralized nature of decision-making.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for a 'Collective Intelligence Investment Exchange' (CIIE) offers an innovative approach to integrating individual investors into hedge fund operations, it raises concerns about regulatory oversight and accountability. The SEC's primary mandate is to ensure market integrity and protect investors, which could be compromised in a decentralized AI-driven marketplace without a robust regulatory framework.

While enhancing transparency and reducing risks is a priority, the SEC's role is to ensure fair market practices and protect investors, which could be compromised if hedge funds operate within a framework where they are controlled by decentralized, collective decision-making.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Хедж-фонды' shifts the control of investment strategies from the 'WallStreetBets community' to a centralized entity, undermining the community's core value of individual empowerment and high-risk trading strategies. The focus on diversification and lower-risk assets does not align with the community's desire for maximizing short-term gains through high-risk trades.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: The proposal from 'Цена акций компании' introduces a complex system that may hinder the SEC's primary goal of ensuring transparency and protecting investors. While the idea of a 'Global Dividend Sharing Cooperative' aims for equitable wealth distribution, it could complicate regulatory oversight and dilute the SEC's effectiveness in enforcing compliance with federal securities laws. Additionally, diverting focus towards decentralized trust funds and corporate governance engagement may detract from addressing the immediate issue of large financial funds limiting individual investors' opportunities. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's current objectives and responsibilities.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Цена акций компании' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: The proposal by 'Цена акций компании' to establish a 'Global Dividend Sharing Cooperative' does not align with the core interests of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk trading strategies and short-term gains. While the initiative may aim for equitable wealth distribution and long-term stability, it undermines the speculative trading nature that the community values. Additionally, the community's current lack of desires and fears indicates a preference for maintaining their existing trading strategies rather than shifting focus towards holding shares and participating in corporate governance.
