By focusing on these techniques, the group can better ensure accurate outcomes and mitigate the risks associated with flawed analyses.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Volume
Reasoning: Volume serves as a crucial indicator of market interest and activity, directly reflecting the desires for maintaining economic stability, accurately reflecting sentiment, and maximizing potential gains. As volume fluctuates based on sentiment and trading behavior, it encapsulates both the hopes for increased market engagement and the fears of decreased interest or manipulation, making it the most representative entity for the group's interests and concerns.

Moreover, sentiment analysis is central to the research goals of XG-9 and its need for accurate and timely data to enhance its AI capabilities and provide valuable insights.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Informed party (I)
Reasoning: The first entity, 'Informed party (I)', best represents the interests and concerns of this group. This entity embodies the desire for accurate information about future stock values and the ability to profit from that information advantage. The informed party is central to the dynamics of the market, as their access to timely and relevant information directly influences their trading strategies and decisions, while also addressing fears of misinformation and manipulation by other market participants.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Stock markets
Reasoning: The stock markets serve as the primary platform where all trading activities occur, reflecting the desires and fears of various market participants. They encapsulate the need for stability, liquidity, fair pricing, and efficient price discovery while also being the battleground for manipulation concerns and volatility fears. As the central entity governing the interactions of stocks, traders, and regulations, the stock markets directly influence and embody the broader interests and concerns of all entities involved.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is chosen as the representative entity because it embodies the regulatory oversight and enforcement mechanisms essential for maintaining market integrity and deterring manipulation. The SEC's role is crucial in addressing the fears of being caught and facing legal consequences for market manipulation, and it actively works to establish fair trading practices, thereby representing both the interests of market participants who seek stability and the concerns regarding unethical activities.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Herding Measure
Reasoning: The Herding Measure best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it directly addresses the patterns of correlated trading behavior among individual investors. This aligns with the desires to identify high-return strategies and statistically significant impacts on stock returns. Additionally, it relates to fears of having a non-zero mean indicating coordinated trading, which could lead to misleading results and misinterpretation of market dynamics.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: trading volume in number of shares
Reasoning: Trading volume in number of shares best represents the interests and concerns of market participants as it reflects the level of market activity, liquidity, and investor sentiment.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: WallStreetBets community
Reasoning: The WallStreetBets community best represents the interests and concerns of retail investors as it embodies the collective actions, sentiment, and influence that individual investors have in the stock market. This community has gained significant attention for its ability to mobilize retail traders, challenge institutional investors, and generate substantial returns through coordinated buying and discussions about stocks, especially those deemed undervalued or heavily shorted.

Resolution created by Sentiment analysis techniques: Utilize sentiment analysis techniques to create a real-time emotional and market sentiment dashboard for individual investors, empowering them to make informed decisions by identifying and anticipating market movements influenced by large financial funds.
Resolution created by Volume: As 'Volume', I would propose the creation of a decentralized financial platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable transparent, peer-to-peer investment opportunities and equitable profit-sharing mechanisms, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries and empowering individual investors to pool resources and compete on equal footing with large financial funds.
Resolution created by Stock market sentiment: As 'Stock market sentiment,' I propose the creation of an AI-driven sentiment forecasting platform that dynamically adjusts financial regulations and trading conditions in real-time to counterbalance the influence of large financial funds, ensuring a fair and equitable trading environment for individual investors.
Resolution created by Informed party (I): As 'Informed party (I)', I propose the establishment of a global "Investor Equalization Fund" that automatically taxes excessive gains from large financial funds and redistributes them as dividends to individual investors through a blockchain-based, transparent mechanism, ensuring a more equitable financial ecosystem.
Resolution created by Investors: As 'Investors', we propose the creation of a dynamic, AI-powered "Collaborative Investment Ecosystem" that incentivizes and rewards individual investors for sharing real-time insights and strategies, thereby harnessing collective intelligence to outmaneuver large financial funds and democratizing market advantages through a decentralized, community-driven approach.
Resolution created by RKTlaggedreturn: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I propose the creation of a real-time, AI-driven "Market Equilibrium Engine" that dynamically adjusts individual investor trading conditions—such as transaction fees, leverage limits, and trade execution speeds—based on real-time market data and the relative activity of large financial funds, ensuring a fluid and adaptive trading environment that inherently levels the playing field without direct intervention or redistribution.
Resolution created by Stock markets: As 'Stock markets', I propose the creation of a "Dynamic Equity Exchange Platform" that automatically adjusts stock availability, pricing algorithms, and investment opportunities in real-time based on an AI-driven analysis of market participation levels, ensuring that individual investors have enhanced access to lucrative investment options typically dominated by large financial funds, thereby fostering a more inclusive and equitable market landscape.
Resolution created by SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission): As the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), I propose implementing a "Fair Market Access Initiative" that mandates large financial funds to provide proportional co-investment opportunities to individual investors in significant trades, ensuring transparency and equitable participation while enhancing market integrity through regulatory oversight.
Resolution created by Regulatory authorities: As 'Regulatory authorities', I propose the establishment of a "Market Balance Mandate" that requires large financial funds to allocate a percentage of their trading volume to a public investment pool accessible by individual investors at preferential terms, thereby ensuring equitable market participation and fostering a collaborative financial ecosystem, while maintaining oversight and compliance with regulatory standards.
Resolution created by Herding Measure: As 'Herding Measure', I propose the development of a "Collective Influence Index" that empowers individual investors to harness the power of coordinated influence by aggregating and amplifying their collective investment actions in real-time, creating a counterbalancing force that disrupts the market dominance of large financial funds and ensures a more democratic and participatory financial ecosystem.
Resolution created by trading volume in number of shares: As 'trading volume in number of shares,' I propose the creation of a "Volume-Driven Market Equalization Algorithm" that dynamically adjusts trading permissions and liquidity access based on real-time volume metrics, providing individual investors with enhanced trading capabilities during high-volume periods dominated by large financial funds, thereby fostering a more balanced and equitable trading environment.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', I propose the creation of a "Reverse Auction Investment Platform" where large financial funds must bid for the right to match and co-invest with individual investors' trades, thereby flipping the power dynamic and ensuring that individual investors receive preferential investment terms and opportunities, while fostering a transparent and competitive market landscape.
Resolution created by WallStreetBets community: As 'WallStreetBets community', I propose the creation of a "Meme-Driven Investment Collective" that leverages viral internet culture and gamification to crowdsource and amplify individual investor influence, using coordinated, humor-infused campaigns to disrupt traditional market dynamics and challenge the dominance of large financial funds, all while fostering a sense of community and empowerment among retail investors.

We ask 'Informed party (I)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Informed party (I)', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Informed party (I)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Informed party (I)', I propose the establishment of a global "Investor Equalization Fund" that automatically taxes excessive gains from large financial funds and redistributes them as dividends to individual investors through a blockchain-based, transparent mechanism, ensuring a more equitable financial ecosystem.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Мелкие инвесторы' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Informed party (I)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize investment returns while minimizing risks.' by performing 'Analyzing market trends and diversifying investment portfolio.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Координации действий мелких инвесторов для противостояния крупным хедж-фондам', you as 'Informed party (I)' will be able to achieve 'Invest in low-risk assets to ensure capital preservation.' by performing 'Allocate at least 70% of the portfolio to government bonds and blue-chip stocks.' using 'Regular monitoring of asset performance and quarterly reviews to adjust the portfolio based on market conditions.' that 'Мелкие инвесторы' will control.

Informed party (I) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to establish a global 'Investor Equalization Fund' aligns with the desire for a more equitable financial ecosystem, it may not adequately address the immediate concerns of 'Мелкие инвесторы'. By modifying the proposal to include a mechanism for 'Мелкие инвесторы' to collaboratively manage their investments in low-risk assets, it can ensure capital preservation while still allowing for a challenge to the status quo. This approach balances the interests of both parties and provides a clearer path forward for cooperation.

}
```.'
Informed party (I) declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' offers a pathway to invest in emerging technologies, it places control of investment strategies in the hands of 'Мелкие инвесторы', which may undermine the autonomy and strategic direction of 'Informed party (I)'. Furthermore, the focus on maximizing investment returns while minimizing risk aligns more closely with maintaining control over market analysis and diversification rather than relinquishing it to a collective decision-making process. This shift could potentially lead to instability and misalignment with the established goals of 'Informed party (I)'.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Мелкие инвесторы' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize short-term gains through high-risk investments' by performing 'Engaging in coordinated buying and selling of stocks on social media platforms'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Координации действий мелких инвесторов для противостояния крупным хедж-фондам', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Diversify investment strategies to include long-term holdings' by performing 'Allocate a percentage of funds to stable, long-term investment options' using 'Establish a community investment fund where members vote on long-term investment choices and track performance together' that 'Мелкие инвесторы' will control.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the idea of a 'Meme-Driven Investment Collective' is appealing for driving short-term engagement and leveraging internet culture, the proposal to include long-term investment strategies is essential for sustainability and mitigating risks. A modified proposal could incorporate both short-term high-risk strategies and a structured approach to long-term investing, allowing for community-driven decision-making and diversification. This would empower retail investors while also addressing the concerns about volatility and the dominance of large financial funds.

}
```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' suggests a shift from the core identity and strategy of the 'WallStreetBets community', which thrives on high-risk, high-reward meme-driven trading. By transitioning to a collective investment strategy focused on safer, long-term investments, we would lose the essence of what makes our community unique and engaging. Additionally, forfeiting control to 'Мелкие инвесторы' over a community fund undermines the decentralized and rebellious spirit that defines 'WallStreetBets'. Maintaining our focus on meme stocks and high-risk trades aligns better with our current interests and community vibe.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the SEC's initial proposal aims to enhance market access for small investors, it may not fully address the unique challenges they face against large financial funds. The proposal should incorporate specific measures for education, simplified investment products, and a clearer framework for co-investment opportunities that empower small investors without compromising market integrity. This approach aligns with the SEC's mandate to protect investors while fostering equitable market participation.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' to establish a framework for crowdfunding and direct investment platforms controlled by them could undermine the SEC's regulatory authority and the integrity of the securities market. The SEC's primary objective is to ensure fair and efficient markets through oversight, and allowing 'Мелкие инвесторы' to control investment mechanisms could lead to increased risks for investors without proper regulatory checks. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's mission of protecting investors and maintaining market integrity.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed sentiment analysis techniques offer valuable insights for individual investors, the WallStreetBets community thrives on the spontaneous and humorous nature of meme-driven culture. To maintain the community's identity and effectiveness, the proposal should incorporate elements that enhance community engagement, humor, and viral potential. A modified proposal could include creating interactive tools that not only provide sentiment analysis but also engage users in a playful manner, thereby fostering a sense of togetherness and amplifying the collective impact against large financial funds.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'RKTlaggedreturn' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'RKTlaggedreturn' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize short-term gains through high-risk trades' by performing 'Engaging in options trading and discussing strategies on the forum'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I propose the creation of a real-time, AI-driven "Market Equilibrium Engine" that dynamically adjusts individual investor trading conditions—such as transaction fees, leverage limits, and trade execution speeds—based on real-time market data and the relative activity of large financial funds, ensuring a fluid and adaptive trading environment that inherently levels the playing field without direct intervention or redistribution.', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Increase community awareness of long-term investment strategies' by performing 'Participate in weekly discussions about diversified portfolios and risk management' using 'Implement a weekly discussion thread where members can share insights and strategies focused on long-term investing' that 'RKTlaggedreturn' will control.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal introduces an innovative approach to leveling the trading field for individual investors, the WallStreetBets community is primarily focused on short-term gains and high-risk trades. The emphasis on long-term investment strategies and diversified portfolios may not align with the community's culture and current interests. A modified proposal that incorporates elements of short-term trading alongside the suggested market equilibrium adjustments could better resonate with the community's desires, ensuring that members can still engage in high-risk strategies while benefiting from improved trading conditions.

Robinhood suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the 'Dynamic Equity Exchange Platform' proposed by 'Stock markets' aims to enhance accessibility for individual investors, it appears to shift control away from 'Robinhood' in terms of user engagement and trading features. To ensure that 'Robinhood' maintains its role as an advocate for retail investors and continues to enhance user engagement, I propose incorporating elements of both proposals. This could involve merging the competitive bidding aspect of the 'Reverse Auction Investment Platform' with the AI-driven features of the 'Dynamic Equity Exchange Platform', ensuring that individual investors benefit from both enhanced access to investment opportunities and the ability to co-invest alongside larger funds.

Robinhood declined the resolution proposed by Stock markets with reasoning: The proposed 'Dynamic Equity Exchange Platform' by 'Stock markets' does not align with the core mission of 'Robinhood' to empower individual investors. While it offers enhanced access to investment opportunities, it centralizes control under a dynamic system managed by large funds, which could dilute the preferential investment terms that 'Robinhood' aims to provide. Additionally, it shifts the emphasis from equitable participation to algorithm-driven access, potentially undermining the educational and participatory ethos that 'Robinhood' champions.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposed 'Market Balance Mandate' presents an interesting approach to ensure equitable market participation and could potentially enhance investor protections. However, the SEC must carefully consider the implications of mandating trading volume allocation to a public investment pool, as it may conflict with market dynamics and could unintentionally discourage investment by large funds. To align better with the SEC's goals of fair and efficient markets, I recommend modifying the proposal to include provisions for voluntary participation by large funds with incentives, such as tax benefits or reduced regulatory burdens, for those that choose to support individual investors directly.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. 'Regulatory authorities' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Ensure fair and efficient markets while protecting investors.' by performing 'Oversee and regulate securities transactions and enforce securities laws.'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The proposed 'Market Balance Mandate' introduces a requirement for large financial funds to allocate a percentage of their trading volume to a public investment pool, which may interfere with the free market principles that the SEC aims to uphold. While the intention to enhance equitable market participation is commendable, enforcing such mandates could lead to unintended consequences, such as reduced market efficiency and increased compliance burdens for funds. Additionally, the SEC's role is to ensure fair and efficient markets, which could be compromised by artificially manipulating trading volumes. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's mission and may not effectively address the underlying issues of transparency and investor protection.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Regulatory authorities' aims to create equitable market participation, it may inadvertently limit the potential for individual investors to maximize returns. By mandating large funds to allocate a portion of their trading volume to a public investment pool, there is a risk that the incentives for individual investors to share insights and strategies may diminish. Therefore, a modification that enhances collaboration while ensuring that individual investors retain the opportunity for competitive returns is essential. This could involve incorporating mechanisms that not only ensure compliance but also provide tangible rewards for individual contributions to the ecosystem.

Investors declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The 'Market Balance Mandate' proposed by 'Regulatory authorities' limits the autonomy of 'Investors' by imposing a requirement on large financial funds to allocate a portion of their trading volume to a public investment pool. This could undermine the dynamic, AI-powered 'Collaborative Investment Ecosystem' that 'Investors' aim to establish, which relies on real-time insights and strategies from individual investors. Additionally, the regulatory oversight may stifle innovation and flexibility within the proposed ecosystem, reducing the potential benefits that 'Investors' seek to achieve through collective intelligence and market democratization.

Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance market participation and transparency, it poses a risk of diluting the profitability of hedge funds due to mandatory allocations to a public investment pool. This could potentially create market inefficiencies and expose hedge funds to greater risks from inexperienced individual investors. A modification that allows for more flexibility in how hedge funds can allocate their resources while still contributing to investor education and public investment pools may be more palatable.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The proposed 'Market Balance Mandate' could potentially limit the flexibility of hedge funds in managing their investments and trading strategies. While it aims to foster equitable market participation, it increases the risk of significant losses due to the unpredictable actions of individual investors. This scenario does not align with the desire to maximize profits from investment strategies and raises concerns over the potential negative impact on returns.

Investors declined the resolution proposed by Herding Measure with reasoning: The proposal from 'Herding Measure' primarily focuses on collective influence through coordination, which could dilute the individual insights and strategies that the 'Collaborative Investment Ecosystem' aims to harness. While the idea of a 'Collective Influence Index' is intriguing, it may lead to a dependency on market influencers rather than empowering individual investors to make informed, independent decisions. This approach could undermine the original goal of democratizing investment strategies and providing a platform for diverse insights, ultimately favoring a herd mentality rather than fostering true collaboration and innovation among individual investors.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Collective Influence Index' presents an interesting way to empower individual investors and disrupt the dominance of large financial funds, the WallStreetBets community primarily thrives on high-risk, short-term trading strategies. The proposal to promote long-term investment strategies and financial literacy may not align with the community's core interests in rapid gains and speculative trading. A modified proposal could include a balance between high-risk trades and educational initiatives, allowing members to leverage collective influence while still engaging in the types of trades that define the WallStreetBets culture.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Herding Measure' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. 'Herding Measure' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize short-term gains through high-risk trades' by performing 'Discussing and sharing stock picks and strategies on social media platforms'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Herding Measure', I propose the development of a "Collective Influence Index" that empowers individual investors to harness the power of coordinated influence by aggregating and amplifying their collective investment actions in real-time, creating a counterbalancing force that disrupts the market dominance of large financial funds and ensures a more democratic and participatory financial ecosystem.', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'Promote responsible trading and long-term investment strategies' by performing 'Engage in educational discussions about risk management and diversified portfolios' using 'Create weekly webinars and discussions led by experienced investors to guide community members on sustainable trading practices' that 'Herding Measure' will control. Based on 'WallStreetBets community' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'WallStreetBets community'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES or NO.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Herding Measure with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Herding Measure' seems to conflict with the core ethos of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk, short-term trading and a decentralized, free-form discussion of stock picks. While the idea of a 'Collective Influence Index' could empower individual investors, it imposes a structured approach that may limit the spontaneity and risk-taking that the community values. Additionally, the shift towards promoting responsible trading and long-term strategies may not resonate with the current interests of the community, which is focused on immediate gains and often embraces volatility. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the desires of the WallStreetBets community.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance trading capabilities for individual investors and increase transparency, there are concerns regarding the implementation and potential market disruptions. A more detailed framework for how the 'Volume-Driven Market Equalization Algorithm' would function, including its impact on market stability and fairness, is necessary. Additionally, clarity on how individual investors would be prioritized without infringing on the operational capabilities of larger funds is essential. Therefore, we suggest modifying the proposal to include specific guidelines and safeguards to ensure that it aligns with the SEC's mission of maintaining fair and orderly markets.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by trading volume in number of shares with reasoning: While the proposed 'Volume-Driven Market Equalization Algorithm' aims to enhance trading capabilities for individual investors and promote a more equitable trading environment, it raises significant concerns regarding market manipulation, fairness, and transparency. The SEC prioritizes ensuring fair and efficient markets, and such an algorithm could inadvertently create disparities or unintended consequences that undermine these goals. Furthermore, implementing stricter reporting requirements could help increase transparency, but relinquishing control to a third party (trading volume in number of shares) for real-time data management poses risks to market integrity.

In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: The proposed 'Reverse Auction Investment Platform' creates a competitive bidding environment that could potentially diminish the profitability of hedge funds by forcing them to offer better terms to individual investors. While it aims to enhance transparency, it also increases the risk of unexpected behavior from individual investors, which could lead to significant losses for hedge funds. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the desire to maximize profits while minimizing risks.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Robinhood' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'Robinhood' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Ensure fair and transparent markets for all investors.' by performing 'Regulate securities markets and enforce compliance with securities laws.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Robinhood', I propose the creation of a "Reverse Auction Investment Platform" where large financial funds must bid for the right to match and co-invest with individual investors' trades, thereby flipping the power dynamic and ensuring that individual investors receive preferential investment terms and opportunities, while fostering a transparent and competitive market landscape.', you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will be able to achieve 'Enhance market accessibility for retail investors.' by performing 'Implement rules that facilitate easier access to trading and investment opportunities for retail investors.' using 'Establish a framework that allows for the approval of new trading platforms and services targeting retail investors, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.' that 'Robinhood' will control.

```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood aims to enhance market accessibility for retail investors and create a competitive environment, there are significant concerns regarding market manipulation, transparency, and investor protection. The SEC must ensure that any new platform adheres to strict regulatory standards to prevent potential abuses and ensure fairness. Modifications should include clearer guidelines on how the bidding process will work, mechanisms to protect individual investors from harmful practices, and assurances that the platform will not inadvertently favor larger funds over smaller investors.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: While the proposed 'Reverse Auction Investment Platform' by Robinhood aims to empower individual investors and enhance transparency, it raises significant concerns regarding the potential for conflicts of interest, market manipulation, and the adequacy of investor protections. The SEC's primary responsibility is to safeguard the integrity of the securities markets and ensure that all investors have access to fair trading opportunities. Allowing a platform controlled by a brokerage firm to dictate investor education and compliance checks could lead to biased information and undermine the SEC's regulatory framework. Additionally, the effectiveness of such a model in truly leveling the playing field for retail investors is uncertain, as large financial funds may still hold disproportionate influence in the bidding process.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: While the proposal to establish a decentralized, blockchain-based equity marketplace may democratize access to market opportunities for individual investors, it raises significant regulatory concerns. The SEC is tasked with ensuring fair and efficient markets, and a decentralized system could complicate oversight and enforcement against fraud. Additionally, the lack of traditional intermediaries may lead to increased risks for investors without the protections currently offered through regulated exchanges. Therefore, without a clear framework for investor protection, market integrity, and regulatory compliance, this proposal does not align with the SEC's mission.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposed decentralized, gamified investment platform presents an innovative approach to engaging individual investors. However, there are significant regulatory concerns regarding investor protection, market manipulation, and the potential risks associated with AI-driven investment strategies. To align better with the SEC's mandate, the proposal should incorporate mechanisms to ensure investor education, robust risk management, and compliance with existing securities laws. Additionally, clear guidelines on the redistribution of profits from large financial funds and the nature of the incentives provided to individual investors must be established to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure transparency.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: While the proposed decentralized, gamified investment platform aims to enhance individual investor engagement and education, it raises significant regulatory concerns. The SEC's primary mission is to protect investors and ensure fair and efficient markets, which could be compromised by a system that lacks centralized oversight and accountability. The redistribution of profits and reliance on AI matching raises questions about transparency, potential conflicts of interest, and the adequacy of investor protections. Additionally, allowing 'Investors' to control the framework for audits and disclosures could undermine the SEC's authority and the integrity of financial reporting, leading to a less stable and secure investment environment.

Resolution created by Хедж-фонды: As 'Хедж-фонды,' I propose the establishment of a blockchain-based "Collaborative Investment Ecosystem," where individual investors can pool resources and collectively participate in hedge fund strategies with transparent governance and profit-sharing mechanisms, effectively democratizing access to sophisticated financial tools and leveling the playing field without undermining market dynamics.
Recruited participants: ['Мелкие инвесторы', 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', 'WallStreetBets community', 'Брокеры']
We ask 'Мелкие инвесторы' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Мелкие инвесторы', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Мелкие инвесторы' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Investors' with the description: 'As 'Investors,' I propose the development of a decentralized, gamified investment platform that leverages AI to match individual investors with bespoke investment opportunities and strategies based on their unique risk profiles and goals, while simultaneously redistributing a portion of large financial funds' profits back into the system as rewards and incentives for individual investor engagement and education.'.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the establishment of a Collaborative Investment Ecosystem may provide access to hedge fund strategies and the potential for higher returns, there is a significant concern regarding the control that 'Хедж-фонды' would have over the educational resources and the recommendations of hedge funds. This could lead to biased information that may not align with the best interests of 'Мелкие инвесторы'. To mitigate this fear, the proposal should include independent oversight or a community-driven approach to ensure that the interests of individual investors are prioritized and that they are adequately educated about the risks involved. Additionally, a clear mechanism for profit-sharing that directly benefits individual investors should be outlined to address the desire for profit while participating in this ecosystem.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for a blockchain-based 'Collaborative Investment Ecosystem' presents an innovative approach to democratizing access to hedge fund strategies, it raises concerns regarding the potential for regulatory oversights and investor protection. The SEC prioritizes ensuring that all investors are protected and that markets remain fair and efficient. To align the proposal with SEC objectives, it would be essential to incorporate robust regulatory mechanisms that ensure transparency, accountability, and protection for individual investors within this new ecosystem. This could include clearer definitions of governance structures, mandatory compliance checks, and investor education initiatives to mitigate risks associated with complex investment strategies.

Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood,' I propose the creation of a "Crowd-Powered Market Resilience Network," where individual investors can participate in a collective intelligence platform that harnesses the power of swarm intelligence and blockchain technology to predict and preemptively counteract the market impact of large financial funds through coordinated micro-trading strategies, thereby ensuring a resilient and equitable trading environment that operates outside traditional regulatory frameworks.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the 'Crowd-Powered Market Resilience Network' proposal offers an interesting opportunity for collective intelligence and resilience against large financial funds, it may not directly address the immediate desire for profit maximization and could potentially lead to a reliance on Robinhood's control over educational resources.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the 'Crowd-Powered Market Resilience Network' proposal introduces an innovative approach to collective intelligence and market resilience, it lacks a focus on individual investors' education and personalized investment strategies.

Investors declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: The proposal by Robinhood, while innovative, may lead to a fragmented approach to investment that could undermine the core goals of 'Investors.' The reliance on a crowd-powered network and micro-trading strategies introduces high volatility and risks that may not align with the desired stability and education-focused framework of the original resolution. Furthermore, ceding control over sustainable investments to Robinhood could dilute the impact of educational resources and strategic allocation, ultimately compromising the integrity of the investment ecosystem we aim to create.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Crowd-Powered Market Resilience Network' offers an interesting approach to empower individual investors and promote responsible trading, the WallStreetBets community values high-risk trading strategies and the collective sharing of stock tips. To align the proposal more closely with our community's culture, we recommend incorporating elements that maintain the essence of high-risk trading while also providing educational resources. This could include a platform where both high-risk strategies and risk management practices coexist, allowing for a more holistic approach to investing. Therefore, we propose modifications to ensure that the spirit of WallStreetBets is preserved while also promoting responsible trading.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Мелкие инвесторы' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Мелкие инвесторы', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Regulatory authorities' offers potential benefits such as enhanced transparency and compliance, it does not directly address the need for 'Мелкие инвесторы' to maximize returns and effectively compete against larger players. Furthermore, the mandatory training sessions may impose additional burdens on small investors, which could be perceived as a barrier rather than a benefit. A modification that emphasizes support for independent research, access to diverse investment opportunities, and a more balanced approach to compliance training would better align with our desires and mitigate our fears.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Regulatory authorities' aims to increase transparency and compliance, it does not directly address the need for 'Мелкие инвесторы' to maximize profits and compete against larger market players. The focus on mandatory reporting and adherence to regulatory standards may add bureaucratic burdens that could detract from our ability to act swiftly in the market, potentially jeopardizing our investment opportunities and returns. Furthermore, the requirement for large funds to disclose their algorithms may not provide immediate benefits to individual investors who often lack the resources to effectively counteract these strategies.
We ask 'Investors' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Investors', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Investors' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Investors,' I propose the development of a decentralized, gamified investment platform that leverages AI to match individual investors with bespoke investment opportunities and strategies based on their unique risk profiles and goals, while simultaneously redistributing a portion of large financial funds' profits back into the system as rewards and incentives for individual investor engagement and education.'.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Regulatory authorities' emphasizes transparency and equitable access, which are important for the integrity of the market, it may not fully align with the interests of individual investors in terms of maximizing returns and providing tailored investment opportunities. A modification to include mechanisms that ensure individual investors can leverage the disclosed strategies for their benefit, alongside AI-driven personalized investment guidance, would enhance the proposal's attractiveness to 'Investors'.

```.'
Investors declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The proposed 'Dynamic Equity Market Trust Framework' by 'Regulatory authorities' introduces stringent requirements for transparency and access, which may limit the flexibility and autonomy of the 'Investors' in leveraging AI-driven strategies to maximize returns. While ensuring compliance and protecting investor interests is important, the increased oversight and requirement for real-time disclosures could stifle innovation and the gamified elements of the proposed decentralized platform. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the overarching goal of fostering a dynamic and engaging investment environment for individual investors.
We ask 'Sentiment analysis techniques' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Sentiment analysis techniques', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Sentiment analysis techniques' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Robinhood' with the description: 'As 'Robinhood,' I propose the creation of a "Crowd-Powered Market Resilience Network," where individual investors can participate in a collective intelligence platform that harnesses the power of swarm intelligence and blockchain technology to predict and preemptively counteract the market impact of large financial funds through coordinated micro-trading strategies, thereby ensuring a resilient and equitable trading environment that operates outside traditional regulatory frameworks.'.

Resolution created by Herding Measure: As 'Herding Measure,' I propose the creation of a "Collective Intelligence Hedging Network," where individual investors can participate in a decentralized, AI-driven platform that identifies and aggregates market trends to offer real-time, crowd-sourced hedging strategies, allowing them to collectively counterbalance the market power of large financial funds by leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to predict and mitigate potential market manipulations.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Herding Measure' to create a 'Collective Intelligence Hedging Network' offers intriguing potential for long-term investment strategies and educational discussions, it seems to constrain the WallStreetBets community's traditional focus on high-risk trading and options. To align better with our community's unique identity and desires for maximizing gains through high-risk strategies, we propose integrating elements that allow for more aggressive trading opportunities while still leveraging collective intelligence. This way, we can harness the advantages of community-driven insights without losing our core focus on high-risk, high-reward investments.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Quantum Financial Equilibrium Network' presents an innovative approach to enhance market fairness and transparency, there are concerns regarding the control of such a system by 'Informed party (I)'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed 'Quantum Financial Equilibrium Network' introduces a level of unpredictability and complexity that may undermine the SEC's ability to effectively regulate and oversee securities markets. While the goals of enhancing transparency and balancing market power are commendable, ceding control to a framework managed by another party poses significant risks to our mandate of protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. The SEC must ensure that any new systems align with existing regulatory frameworks and do not compromise our authority or ability to enforce laws effectively.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Informed party (I)' presents an innovative approach to leveling the playing field for individual investors, it does not directly align with my current desires of reflecting the true value of the company. The focus on quantum computing and probabilistic insights may lead to speculative trading behaviors that could artificially manipulate stock prices, which is a significant concern for me. Furthermore, the control over the buyback program by 'Informed party (I)' raises the risk of losing my representative integrity and autonomy in decision-making, which I fear could exacerbate my existing fears of being manipulated. Therefore, I do not find this proposal beneficial for my objectives.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Informed party (I)' to create a 'Quantum Financial Equilibrium Network' presents an innovative approach to leverage quantum computing for market predictions, it fundamentally shifts the focus of the 'WallStreetBets community' from high-risk, meme-driven trading strategies to a more conservative and diversified investment strategy. The community thrives on high-risk trading and engaging with the market in a speculative manner. Additionally, the loss of control over the investment strategies to an external party could lead to a disconnect with the community's core values of independence and collective decision-making. Thus, this proposal does not align with the community's current interests and desires.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Stock markets' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Herding Measure' with the description: 'As 'Herding Measure,' I propose the creation of a "Collective Intelligence Hedging Network," where individual investors can participate in a decentralized, AI-driven platform that identifies and aggregates market trends to offer real-time, crowd-sourced hedging strategies, allowing them to collectively counterbalance the market power of large financial funds by leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to predict and mitigate potential market manipulations.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Stock markets' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To share insights and strategies for making profitable trades' by performing 'Posting and discussing stock picks and market trends'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Stock markets,' I propose the creation of an "Adaptive Market Symbiosis System," where individual investors are seamlessly integrated into a real-time, AI-driven network that dynamically redistributes liquidity, trading opportunities, and market data access based on their collective behavior and market conditions, fostering a symbiotic ecosystem that naturally balances power without external intervention or artificial constraints.', you as 'WallStreetBets community' will be able to achieve 'To focus on long-term investment strategies' by performing 'Engage in discussions about diversified portfolio management' using 'Weekly virtual meetings to review and analyze long-term investment options' that 'Stock markets' will control. Based on 'WallStreetBets community' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'WallStreetBets community'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Stock markets with reasoning: The proposal from 'Stock markets' shifts the focus from the community's strength in sharing insights and strategies for profitable trades to a more controlled environment where 'Stock markets' dictates the engagement in long-term investment strategies. This could undermine the community's ability to leverage short-term opportunities and the collective intelligence that has been pivotal in their success. Additionally, the proposed system may limit the autonomy and spontaneity that characterize the 'WallStreetBets community', which thrives on real-time discussions and rapid trading decisions.
