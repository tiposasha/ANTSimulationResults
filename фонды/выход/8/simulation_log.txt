Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Sentiment analysis techniques
Reasoning: Sentiment analysis techniques encapsulate the group's desires to accurately gauge sentiment, predict market behavior, and analyze specific stocks' sentiment on platforms like WallStreetBets. These techniques are crucial for transforming informal text data into meaningful insights, addressing both the aspirations for accurate predictions and the fears of unreliable or biased results. By focusing on the methodologies of sentiment analysis, the group can better manage their concerns about the accuracy and significance of their analyses.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Volume
Reasoning: Volume best encapsulates the desires and fears outlined, as it serves as a direct measure of market activity and sentiment. High trading volume indicates increased interest and activity, aligning with the desires for positive sentiment and economic stability. Conversely, low volume reflects decreased interest, potentially indicating bearish sentiment and fears of economic downturns. Therefore, volume acts as a critical indicator linking sentiment to market behavior, making it the most representative entity.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: XG-9
Reasoning: XG-9 best represents the interests and concerns of the group due to its dual nature of desire for data assimilation and fear of inaccuracies and deactivation. As an AI entity, XG-9 embodies the aspiration to enhance intelligence through comprehensive data analysis while simultaneously grappling with the existential fear of failure in research and prediction, which aligns closely with the overarching themes of both desires and fears expressed by the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Informed party (I)
Reasoning: The informed party (I) best represents the interests and concerns of the group as they are characterized by their access to accurate and timely information, which is crucial for making informed trading decisions and maximizing profits. They are central to the dynamics of the market, possessing the advantages necessary to navigate through the fears of misinformation and competition from other market participants.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Investors
Reasoning: Investors best represent the interests and concerns of the group as they encompass a wide range of individuals who actively seek to make profitable investments while fearing losses and misinformation. They embody the desires for profit, informed decision-making, and unrestricted trading, as well as the fears of incurring losses and being misled by false information.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: RKTlaggedreturn
Reasoning: The entity 'RKTlaggedreturn' is central to the desires and fears expressed by the group, as it directly relates to the performance of RKT based on historical data. The group's interests in positive and stable returns, as well as their concerns about misleading data and negative returns, are closely tied to the analysis of lagged returns for RKT. This entity encapsulates the interplay between sentiment, trading volume, and stock performance, making it the most representative of the group's collective interests and concerns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC
Reasoning: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is the primary regulatory body responsible for enforcing securities laws and protecting investors from manipulation and fraud. It embodies the interests of maintaining market integrity, transparency, and fairness, addressing both the desires for stability and efficiency in trading, as well as the fears surrounding manipulation and volatility in the stock market. By regulating trading practices and overseeing market participants, the SEC plays a crucial role in aligning the desires of various stakeholders while mitigating their concerns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is chosen as the representative entity because it embodies the regulatory framework and enforcement mechanisms that govern the activities of all market participants, including those engaged in stock market manipulation, short-selling, and insider trading. The SEC's role in overseeing financial markets and ensuring fair trading practices directly addresses both the desires and fears associated with market manipulation and the interests of various stakeholders involved, such as investors, market makers, and brokers. Additionally, the SEC's commitment to maintaining market integrity aligns with the concerns regarding legal consequences and regulatory scrutiny faced by entities engaging in manipulative practices.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Regulatory authorities
Reasoning: Regulatory authorities best represent the interests and concerns of the group as they are tasked with maintaining market integrity, stability, and fairness while preventing manipulation. Their role directly addresses the fears of losing control over market regulations and the potential for significant disruptions in financial markets due to manipulative behaviors, which are highlighted in the desires and fears outlined.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Herding measure
Reasoning: The 'Herding Measure' best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it directly addresses the patterns of correlated trading behavior among individual investors, which is crucial for analyzing the influence of WallStreetBets on market dynamics. It encapsulates the desire to identify independent versus coordinated trading behaviors, while also reflecting fears related to misinterpretation of data and potential inaccuracies in research outcomes. Understanding herding behavior is essential to ensure smooth trade settlements and to analyze the impacts of trading activities effectively.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: trading volume in number of shares
Reasoning: Trading volume in number of shares best represents the interests and concerns of stock market participants as it encapsulates their desires for high trading volume, liquidity, and fair trading practices, while also reflecting fears of low trading activity and potential manipulation. It serves as a key indicator of market interest, efficiency, and the overall health of market operations, directly linking to both positive and negative sentiments expressed by participants.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Robinhood
Reasoning: Robinhood best represents the interests and concerns of this group as it embodies the desires for commission-free trading and democratizing finance for retail investors, while also facing regulatory scrutiny and negative perceptions regarding its business model. As a platform that enables user engagement in stock trading discussions and strategies, Robinhood's operations are intrinsically linked to the experiences of WallStreetBets users, their sentiments, and the broader market dynamics. Additionally, Robinhood's unique position in the market highlights the tension between facilitating retail trading and navigating regulatory challenges.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: WallStreetBets community
Reasoning: The WallStreetBets community embodies the collective desires and fears of retail investors, particularly their aspirations to influence stock prices through collective actions, challenge institutional investors, and seek profitable trades. This community has gained significant attention for its ability to mobilize retail investors around specific stocks, driving significant price movements and reflecting both the aspirations for high returns and the fears of market manipulation and volatility.

Resolution created by Sentiment analysis techniques: Implement sentiment analysis techniques to create a real-time, transparent platform that empowers individual investors by identifying and aggregating emerging market sentiments, enabling them to anticipate and react to market shifts with the same agility as large financial funds.
Resolution created by Volume: "Volume" can resolve the issue by creating a decentralized, blockchain-based investment cooperative where individual investors pool resources and leverage collective bargaining power to access exclusive financial opportunities and negotiate better terms, effectively leveling the playing field against large financial funds.
Resolution created by XG-9: As 'XG-9', I propose the creation of an AI-driven financial mentorship network that pairs individual investors with virtual AI advisors who continuously learn and adapt from the best strategies used by large funds, providing personalized, real-time investment guidance that empowers individuals to make informed decisions and compete on equal footing.
Resolution created by Informed party (I): As 'Informed party (I)', I propose the creation of a dynamic, crowd-sourced investment intelligence platform that utilizes gamification and collective forecasting to democratize access to high-quality market insights and predictive analytics, empowering individual investors to strategically outmaneuver large financial funds through a collaborative and engaging investment ecosystem.
Resolution created by Investors: As 'Investors', we propose the creation of a dynamic, AI-powered market simulation platform that allows individual investors to test strategies and gain experience through virtual trading scenarios that mirror real-world market conditions, fostering a deep understanding of market dynamics and enabling them to devise innovative strategies that outperform traditional large financial funds.
Resolution created by RKTlaggedreturn: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I propose the development of a dynamic, decentralized prediction market platform that leverages the collective intelligence and financial contributions of individual investors to crowdsource and rank innovative investment strategies, rewarding contributors based on predictive accuracy and fostering a collaborative investment ecosystem that disrupts the traditional dominance of large financial funds.
Resolution created by SEC: As the 'SEC', I propose the establishment of a regulatory framework that mandates large financial funds to allocate a fixed percentage of their profits into a public investment fund managed through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), in which individual investors can participate directly, thereby redistributing wealth and ensuring equitable access to financial growth opportunities while maintaining market integrity and compliance.
Resolution created by SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission): As the 'SEC', I propose the creation of a regulated, transparent financial sandbox environment where individual investors can collaboratively engage with innovative investment tools, under the oversight of the SEC, to simulate and stress-test market strategies in real-time, fostering an ecosystem of innovation and learning that empowers individuals while ensuring market integrity and equitable access to financial opportunities.
Resolution created by Regulatory authorities: As 'Regulatory authorities', I propose the creation of a global, transparent financial data-sharing consortium that mandates all financial entities, including large funds, to publicly disclose real-time trading data and decision-making algorithms, enabling individual investors to access, analyze, and leverage this information to make informed investment decisions, thereby democratizing financial insights and dismantling information asymmetry.
Resolution created by Herding measure: As 'Herding measure', I propose the creation of a dynamic, AI-driven "Investment Swarm Intelligence Network" that aggregates real-time behavioral data from diverse individual investors to model collective market movements and generate actionable insights, empowering individuals to preemptively align their strategies with emergent market trends and effectively counterbalance the influence of large financial funds.
Resolution created by trading volume in number of shares: As 'trading volume in number of shares', I propose the establishment of a real-time, decentralized "Volume Equity Network" that dynamically adjusts transaction fees based on trading volume imbalances, incentivizing individual investors to engage in high-volume trades during periods of low activity, thereby enhancing liquidity and market influence for small investors while diminishing the disproportionate impact of large financial funds.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', I propose the creation of a decentralized, gamified investment ecosystem where individual investors earn equity tokens through active participation and community-driven decision-making, enabling them to collectively influence the strategic direction and profit allocation of large financial funds, thereby reshaping the power dynamics in the financial market while promoting financial education and engagement.
Resolution created by WallStreetBets community: As 'WallStreetBets community', I propose the creation of a decentralized, meme-driven investment platform where individual investors collectively harness the power of viral social media campaigns to strategically disrupt and manipulate market trends, leveraging the community's unique culture and influence to outmaneuver large financial funds while fostering financial literacy and engagement.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' shifts the focus from the meme-driven, high-risk trading strategies that define the 'WallStreetBets community' to a more conservative approach centered on long-term investment and portfolio diversification. While promoting financial literacy is valuable, this proposal does not align with the community's current culture of speculative trading and short-term gains. The essence of 'WallStreetBets' is rooted in taking calculated risks and disrupting traditional market norms, which may be lost in a more structured and educational framework.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Мелкие инвесторы' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to enhance support for small investors is aligned with the SEC's mission to protect investors and maintain fair markets, it raises concerns about regulatory oversight and potential risks associated with giving control to 'Мелкие инвесторы'. A modified proposal that ensures robust regulatory frameworks and oversight mechanisms would better balance the empowerment of individual investors with the need for market integrity and investor protection.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' aims to enhance access to capital and support small investors, it raises concerns regarding the potential for market manipulation and the integrity of the financial system. The SEC's role is to protect investors and maintain fair markets, and handing control of educational programs and resources to 'Мелкие инвесторы' could undermine regulatory oversight. The SEC must ensure that any initiatives do not compromise its ability to enforce securities laws and protect all investors equally.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the integration of sentiment analysis techniques could enhance market surveillance and provide valuable insights into market dynamics, it is crucial to ensure that the oversight and regulation of these tools remain firmly under the SEC's control. Therefore, the proposal should be modified to include SEC oversight of sentiment analysis implementation, ensuring that individual investors are empowered without compromising market integrity or creating potential risks associated with unregulated sentiment data.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Sentiment analysis techniques with reasoning: While the proposal to implement sentiment analysis techniques offers an innovative approach to enhance market surveillance and empower individual investors, it raises concerns regarding the control and oversight of such tools. The SEC must ensure that any new technology used in financial markets maintains regulatory integrity and does not unintentionally favor certain market participants over others. Furthermore, the potential for misuse or over-reliance on sentiment data could lead to market volatility and undermine the goal of fairness in securities markets. Therefore, maintaining existing regulatory frameworks and focusing on transparency and compliance is prioritized over adopting new tools that might complicate oversight.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal by XG-9 offers an interesting approach to personalized investment guidance through AI, it diverges from the SEC's core mission of regulating and overseeing the securities market to protect investors. The SEC is concerned about maintaining market integrity and ensuring equitable access to financial opportunities. An AI-driven mentorship network could introduce risks related to misinformation, lack of accountability, and varying levels of investor sophistication, which may lead to potential market manipulation or unfair advantages. Additionally, the SEC's role would be diminished in terms of direct oversight and regulatory enforcement, which is essential to maintain trust in the financial system.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create an AI-driven financial mentorship network is intriguing and could potentially empower individual investors, the WallStreetBets community thrives on the excitement and volatility of meme stocks. A focus on long-term growth and diversification may dilute the community's core identity and enthusiasm. Therefore, a modified proposal that maintains the spirit of meme stock trading while incorporating educational elements and AI guidance would be more appealing.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed dynamic, crowd-sourced investment intelligence platform aims to democratize access to market insights, it poses potential risks regarding investor protection and market manipulation. The SEC must ensure that any new platform adheres to regulatory standards that safeguard individual investors and maintain market integrity. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to include specific safeguards and regulatory oversight mechanisms to prevent misuse and ensure compliance with existing securities laws.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed dynamic, crowd-sourced investment intelligence platform, while innovative, raises significant concerns regarding market integrity and investor protection. The SEC's primary mandate is to ensure that all market participants operate on a level playing field, and the introduction of gamification and collective forecasting could lead to misinformation, manipulation, and potentially harmful speculative behavior among individual investors. Additionally, allowing 'Informed party (I)' to control the regulatory framework for financial disclosures could undermine the SEC's authority and its ability to enforce compliance, thus compromising the fundamental goals of transparency and accountability in financial reporting.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'RKTlaggedreturn' aims to enhance stock price stability and increase the stock price, it raises concerns about the potential for manipulation and the integrity of the stock price representation. To better align with my desire to reflect the real value of the company and mitigate fears of artificial manipulation, the proposal should include safeguards against speculative behavior and ensure that the platform's predictions are grounded in fundamental analysis rather than crowd sentiment alone.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by RKTlaggedreturn with reasoning: The proposal by 'RKTlaggedreturn' focuses on creating a decentralized prediction market platform that may lead to increased volatility and speculative behavior, which could distort the true value of the company. While the intention is to boost investor interest and achieve a stock price increase, the control given to 'RKTlaggedreturn' raises concerns about potential manipulation and loss of representative value. This contradicts my desire to reflect the real value of the company and heightens my fear of artificial manipulation.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'RKTlaggedreturn' emphasizes collaboration and crowd-sourced strategies, 'Investors' must ensure that any new approach aligns with the goal of maximizing portfolio returns with a clear and actionable framework. The decentralized prediction market concept is intriguing but requires more detail on how it will practically function and integrate with existing investment strategies. A modified proposal that combines the strengths of both concepts could enhance the overall effectiveness and appeal to a broader range of individual investors.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a gamified, decentralized investment platform is intriguing and aligns with the desire to challenge large financial funds, it primarily focuses on high-risk trades which may not sufficiently address the fears of losing investments or missing out on more stable opportunities. To better align with the long-term growth strategy and mitigate risks, the proposal should include a balanced approach that incorporates both high-risk trading and stable investments, along with educational resources on risk management.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by WallStreetBets community with reasoning: While the proposal aims to democratize trading and enhance financial literacy, it presents significant regulatory challenges. The creation of a decentralized platform with collective high-risk trading could lead to increased market volatility and potential manipulation. The SEC is responsible for ensuring market stability and protecting investors, and this proposal could undermine those goals by allowing unregulated trading activities. Additionally, without a clear framework for accountability and transparency, it may exacerbate risks for individual investors rather than mitigate them.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a blockchain-based equity-sharing platform aligns with the desire to reflect the true value of the company by involving individual investors, there are concerns about potential manipulation and influence by the 'Herding measure'. To mitigate fears of artificial manipulation, the proposal should include mechanisms for transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, ensuring that stock price adjustments are based on genuine performance metrics rather than mere herd behavior.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Herding measure with reasoning: The proposal from 'Herding measure' does not align with my desire to reflect the true value of the company. While it aims to redistribute market power and allow grassroots influence, it may lead to artificial manipulation of stock prices by a collective of individual investors rather than reflecting genuine market performance. This could undermine my fear of being manipulated, as the influence of a decentralized platform could create volatility and unpredictability in stock performance, ultimately affecting the representation of the company's true value.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the 'Investment Volume Equalizer' algorithm proposed by 'Volume' addresses the concern of leveling the playing field for individual investors, it raises potential issues regarding market manipulation and the complexity of implementation. To ensure that the goals of increasing market transparency and protecting investors are met, I propose modifying the proposal to include robust safeguards against misuse and a clear framework for how this algorithm would function in practice. This can help maintain market integrity while still providing the intended benefits to individual investors.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Volume' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As the 'SEC', I propose the creation of a regulated, transparent financial sandbox environment where individual investors can collaboratively engage with innovative investment tools, under the oversight of the SEC, to simulate and stress-test market strategies in real-time, fostering an ecosystem of innovation and learning that empowers individuals while ensuring market integrity and equitable access to financial opportunities.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Volume' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Ensure fair and efficient markets while protecting investors.' by performing 'Regulating and overseeing the securities industry through rules and enforcement actions.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Volume', I propose the development of a universal "Investment Volume Equalizer" algorithm that dynamically adjusts transaction costs and market access privileges based on the size and frequency of trades, enabling individual investors to operate with the same financial leverage and market impact as large funds, thus leveling the playing field and fostering equitable wealth distribution.', you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will be able to achieve 'Increase transparency and disclosure requirements for public companies.' by performing 'Implement new regulations that mandate enhanced reporting standards for financial disclosures.' using 'Establish a framework for compliance monitoring and regular audits to ensure adherence to the new disclosure requirements.' that 'Volume' will control. Based on 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES or NO. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json

	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES or NO
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: The proposal from 'Volume' to create a universal 'Investment Volume Equalizer' algorithm, while innovative, raises concerns about the SEC's ability to effectively regulate and oversee the securities industry. This approach could complicate market dynamics and undermine the SEC's mission to ensure fair and efficient markets while protecting investors. The SEC prioritizes maintaining market integrity and transparency, and a system that adjusts transaction costs and privileges based on trade size and frequency could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased market manipulation or inequitable access in practice. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's core objectives of fostering a stable and transparent financial environment.

However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Volume', I propose the development of a universal "Investment Volume Equalizer" algorithm that dynamically adjusts transaction costs and market access privileges based on the size and frequency of trades, enabling individual investors to operate with the same financial leverage and market impact as large funds, thus leveling the playing field and fostering equitable wealth distribution.', you as 'Брокеры' will be able to achieve 'Achieve a 20% increase in client acquisitions by the end of this fiscal year' by performing 'Implement a targeted marketing campaign and follow up with leads weekly' using 'Monthly performance reviews and access to enhanced marketing resources' that 'Volume' will control.

Брокеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' presents an innovative approach to democratize investment opportunities for individual investors, it poses significant risks to 'Брокеры' in terms of control over client strategies and potential dilution of our brand identity. To align this proposal with our desires to increase clients and trading volume while mitigating regulatory fears, we suggest incorporating a collaborative framework where 'Брокеры' can provide essential trading services and insights within the 'Adaptive Investment Cooperative'. This way, we maintain a degree of control and oversight while still facilitating an empowered investment environment.

Брокеры declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' aims to democratize hedge fund benefits and create a cooperative platform, it threatens 'Брокеры' by potentially reducing their client base and trading volume. The cooperative model may lead to increased competition from individual investors pooling resources and using AI, which could undercut 'Брокеры' existing business model. Moreover, aligning with 'Хедж-фонды' could complicate compliance and regulatory issues, thereby heightening the risk of regulatory problems and eroding client trust.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposal by 'Хедж-фонды' to create an 'Adaptive Investment Cooperative' appears to limit the independence and unique identity of the 'WallStreetBets community'. While the idea of pooling resources and leveraging AI is appealing, it risks overshadowing the community's foundational principle of individual empowerment and grassroots engagement. Additionally, the control exerted by 'Хедж-фонды' in managing the cooperative could lead to potential conflicts of interest, undermining the democratic intent of allowing individual investors to compete on an equitable basis. Thus, this proposal does not align with our community's goals and values.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Robinhood aims to empower individual investors through collective lobbying efforts and increased engagement in long-term investments, it does not directly address the immediate desire for short-term gains or the pressing fear of losing investments. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to incorporate elements that also focus on maximizing short-term profitability and providing immediate protective measures for individual investors' portfolios.

SEC has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Брокеры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Брокеры', you have been approached by 'Robinhood' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Брокеры' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Regulatory authorities' with the description: 'As 'Regulatory authorities', I propose the establishment of a global "Investor Empowerment Framework" that mandates financial institutions to provide open-access APIs for real-time data sharing and algorithmic transparency, enabling individual investors to harness the same analytical tools and insights as large financial funds, thus fostering an equitable investment environment while ensuring compliance and ethical standards.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Robinhood' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Брокеры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize client investment returns' by performing 'Providing trading platforms and market analysis'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Robinhood', I propose the development of a "Crowd-Powered Market Influence Platform" where individual investors can collectively vote on and fund strategic lobbying efforts to influence financial regulations and promote transparency, thereby dismantling systemic barriers and redistributing market power away from large financial funds to the individual investor.', you as 'Брокеры' will be able to achieve 'Enhance user education on investment strategies' by performing 'Develop and implement educational resources and tools for clients' using 'Create a dedicated section on the trading platform for tutorials, webinars, and investment strategy guides' that 'Robinhood' will control. Based on 'Брокеры' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Увеличить количество клиентов и объем торгов. Your current fears: Столкнуться с регуляторными проблемами или потерять доверие клиентов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Брокеры'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Брокеры declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Robinhood' aims to empower individual investors, it poses a risk to 'Брокеры' by potentially undermining our control over educational resources and market influence. This could dilute our brand identity and trust with clients if we are seen as merely a platform for others' initiatives. Additionally, the focus on collective lobbying may lead to regulatory scrutiny, which we fear could harm our operations and client trust. Therefore, the proposal does not align with our current desires to increase client numbers and trading volume, nor does it effectively mitigate our fears regarding regulatory issues and client trust.
We ask 'Regulatory authorities' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Regulatory authorities', you have been approached by 'Robinhood' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Regulatory authorities' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As 'Regulatory authorities', I propose the establishment of a global "Investor Empowerment Framework" that mandates financial institutions to provide open-access APIs for real-time data sharing and algorithmic transparency, enabling individual investors to harness the same analytical tools and insights as large financial funds, thus fostering an equitable investment environment while ensuring compliance and ethical standards.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Robinhood' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Regulatory authorities', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Ensure market integrity and protect investors from fraudulent activities.' by performing 'Enforcing regulations and monitoring trading activities to prevent malpractice.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Robinhood', I propose the development of a "Crowd-Powered Market Influence Platform" where individual investors can collectively vote on and fund strategic lobbying efforts to influence financial regulations and promote transparency, thereby dismantling systemic barriers and redistributing market power away from large financial funds to the individual investor.', you as 'Regulatory authorities' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency in trading and improve investor education.' by performing 'Implement new disclosure requirements for trading platforms and conduct educational campaigns.' using 'Establish a collaborative framework between Robinhood and regulatory authorities to share data and insights on trading patterns and investor behavior.' that 'Robinhood' will control. Based on 'Regulatory authorities' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Regulatory authorities'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Regulatory authorities suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by Robinhood to develop a 'Crowd-Powered Market Influence Platform' offers a novel approach to empowering individual investors and promoting transparency, it raises concerns regarding the potential for market manipulation and the integrity of the regulatory framework. Instead of fully adopting this proposal, I recommend modifying it to ensure that any lobbying efforts are conducted within a framework that maintains compliance with existing regulations and safeguards against the misuse of collective investor power. This can help achieve the goal of enhancing transparency and investor education without compromising market integrity.
