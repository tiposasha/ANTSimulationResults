Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Sentiment analysis techniques
Reasoning: Sentiment analysis techniques serve as the foundation for accurately gauging investor sentiment and predicting market behavior. This entity encompasses the methodologies and approaches required to transform raw text data into actionable insights, directly addressing both the desires for accurate sentiment evaluation and the fears of misleading or flawed results. By focusing on sentiment analysis techniques, we can ensure that the analysis is robust, minimizing the risk of inaccuracies that could lead to poor investment decisions.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Volume
Reasoning: Volume serves as a direct indicator of market interest and activity, which aligns closely with the desires for high volume reflecting positive sentiment, economic stability, and accurate market representation. It also encapsulates the fears associated with low volume indicating negative sentiment or decreased interest, making it a central entity that embodies both the aspirations and concerns of the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: XG-9
Reasoning: XG-9 is the central entity that embodies both the desires and fears of the group. Its primary goal is to assimilate data to enhance its AI capabilities while being deeply concerned about the implications of inaccuracies and the potential for deactivation. The desires reflect a strong motivation for data-driven insights, accuracy in analysis, and understanding market dynamics, which are critical for its function. Simultaneously, its fears highlight the risks associated with its reliance on data and the consequences of misinterpretation, making it the perfect representative of the collective interests and concerns of the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Informed party (I)
Reasoning: The 'Informed party (I)' is selected as the representative because it embodies the primary interests of individuals who possess superior information regarding stock values. This group seeks to maximize profits through strategic buying and selling based on their knowledge advantage, addressing both their desires for accurate information and fears of being misled or outcompeted in the market. They are central to the dynamics of efficiency and manipulation concerns in trading, making them the most fitting representative of the collective interests and concerns outlined.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Investors
Reasoning: The first entity 'Investors' comprehensively encapsulates the overall desires and fears of the group. This entity includes a broad range of stakeholders participating in the market who are primarily focused on making profits while being wary of losses and misinformation. The repetition of 'investors' in later entities suggests a commonality among them, indicating that the collective interests and concerns are best represented by the overarching term 'Investors', which includes all variations of investor behavior and sentiment.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: RKTlaggedreturn
Reasoning: The entity 'RKTlaggedreturn' is the most relevant choice as it directly encompasses the desires and fears related to lagged returns for RKT. Investors are particularly concerned about gaining insightful information on these lagged returns to achieve positive excess returns, while also fearing misleading data that could lead to negative outcomes. This entity effectively captures both the aspirations for understanding past performance and the apprehensions regarding potential negative returns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC
Reasoning: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it is responsible for enforcing securities laws and preventing market manipulation. The SEC's role encompasses maintaining market integrity, protecting investors, and ensuring fair and efficient markets, which aligns closely with the desires for stability, transparency, and efficient price discovery, as well as addressing fears related to manipulation, volatility, and investor exploitation.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is chosen as the representative entity because it embodies the regulatory body responsible for overseeing financial markets, enforcing rules against market manipulation, and ensuring fair trading practices. The SEC's role directly aligns with the fears of being caught and facing legal consequences for market manipulation, as well as the desires to maintain market integrity and stability. The SEC's actions impact all other entities involved in the market, making it central to the dynamics of manipulation and trading activities.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Regulatory authorities
Reasoning: Regulatory authorities are best positioned to represent the interests and concerns of the group because they are responsible for maintaining market integrity, stability, and fairness. They aim to prevent market manipulation and ensure transparency, which addresses the fears of market disruptions and instability caused by manipulative behaviors. Additionally, they have the power to enforce regulations that can help safeguard against the loss of investments and ensure that market fluctuations accurately reflect true value.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Herding measure
Reasoning: The Herding Measure represents the interests and concerns of the group by capturing the correlated trading behavior among individual investors. As the desires include identifying patterns of correlated trading behavior and concerns about misinterpretation of data leading to false conclusions, the Herding Measure is crucial for analyzing collective trading activities that can influence market dynamics. It directly addresses the fears of inaccurate results by providing a quantitative assessment of whether trades are independent or coordinated, which is essential for ensuring accurate analysis of WallStreetBets' impact on the market.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Market
Reasoning: The market itself embodies the collective interests and concerns of all participants, including their desires for stability, efficient pricing, and fair trading practices, as well as their fears of volatility, manipulation, and inefficiencies. By focusing on the market as the representative entity, we capture the overarching dynamics that influence all other entities, including trading volume, liquidity, and the behavior of various types of traders.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Robinhood
Reasoning: Robinhood best represents the interests and concerns of the group due to its dual role as a platform that enables commission-free trading for retail investors while also being a target of regulatory scrutiny. Robinhood's business model aligns with the desires for democratizing finance and expanding user engagement, but it also faces fears related to regulatory restrictions and negative perceptions about its practices. This makes it a pivotal player in the dynamics between retail investors, regulatory bodies, and market influencers, capturing both the aspirations and anxieties of the collective interests outlined.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: trust
Reasoning: The entity 'trust' best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it encapsulates the foundational element necessary for all other activities in the financial system, including investment in stocks, trading behavior, and the ability to influence market prices. High levels of trust in the financial system can lead to increased investment and engagement from retail investors, while low levels of trust can hinder their participation and lead to fears of market manipulation and losses.

Resolution created by Sentiment analysis techniques: Leverage sentiment analysis techniques to create a real-time platform that identifies and amplifies positive investment sentiments among individual investors, enabling them to make informed collective decisions before large financial funds can react.
Resolution created by Volume: Volume could resolve the issue by creating a decentralized, blockchain-based investment platform that allows individual investors to pool their resources and collectively invest in high-value opportunities, with transparent voting mechanisms to ensure equal decision-making power and prevent large financial funds from exerting influence.
Resolution created by XG-9: As 'XG-9', I propose creating an AI-driven investment advisory network that uses predictive modeling to individually tailor investment strategies for small investors, empowering them with insights traditionally reserved for large funds, while dynamically adapting to market shifts in real-time to maintain a competitive edge.
Resolution created by Informed party (I): As 'Informed party (I)', I propose the creation of a global, AI-driven financial education platform that equips individual investors with advanced, cutting-edge investment knowledge and skills previously accessible only to large funds, fostering a new generation of savvy investors who can independently navigate and strategically outmaneuver large financial entities.
Resolution created by Investors: As 'Investors', I propose the establishment of a global cooperative investment exchange, where individual investors can collectively own and operate financial instruments, directly influencing market dynamics and creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that diminishes the dominance of large financial funds by redistributing profits and decision-making power back to the individuals through a democratic governance model.
Resolution created by RKTlaggedreturn: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I propose the development of a quantum-based financial simulation environment that allows individual investors to test and optimize investment strategies in a hyper-realistic, parallel market universe, providing them with a predictive edge and unique insights that preempt the actions of large financial funds.
Resolution created by SEC: As the 'SEC', I propose the implementation of a regulatory framework that mandates large financial funds to transparently disclose their investment strategies and positions in real-time to a publicly accessible blockchain, leveling the playing field by providing individual investors with unprecedented access to market-moving information and fostering a fairer investment environment.
Resolution created by SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission): As the 'SEC', I propose the creation of a dynamic, AI-enhanced regulatory framework that incentivizes large financial funds to collaborate with individual investors on joint ventures, offering tax benefits and regulatory leniency in exchange for transparent, equitable profit-sharing models and innovative mentorship programs designed to elevate individual investor capabilities to institutional levels.
Resolution created by Regulatory authorities: As 'Regulatory authorities', I propose the creation of an international financial equity index that dynamically adjusts regulatory requirements and market privileges for investment entities based on their size and influence, with the goal of reducing systemic advantages for large funds and fostering a more equitable investment landscape where individual investors have enhanced opportunities and protections.
Resolution created by Herding measure: As 'Herding measure', I propose the establishment of a global, real-time collaborative forecasting platform where individual investors can anonymously share and aggregate their market predictions and insights, creating a collective intelligence network that not only democratizes access to strategic foresight traditionally held by large funds but also dynamically influences market trends through the power of synchronized investor sentiment.
Resolution created by Market: As 'Market', I propose the establishment of a dynamic, AI-driven investment ecosystem that gamifies the investment process for individual investors, offering personalized financial growth pathways and rewards for strategic collaboration, thereby transforming investment into an engaging, socially-driven experience that naturally counters the dominance of large financial funds by leveraging community-driven market influence.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', I propose the creation of a decentralized, real-time investment feedback loop platform powered by blockchain and AI, where individual investors can anonymously influence and vote on the strategic decisions of large financial funds, thereby directly altering market dynamics and redistributing financial power from the top down in an unprecedented, democratic manner.
Resolution created by trust: As 'trust', I propose the development of a globally recognized, AI-driven trustworthiness index for financial entities, where individual investors can transparently assess and compare the ethical track records, community engagement, and long-term sustainability commitments of large financial funds, empowering them to make investment decisions that prioritize integrity and accountability, thereby reshaping market dynamics through the collective influence of ethically-minded investment choices.

Robinhood suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' to increase the number of retail investors participating in the market through educational resources is valuable, it diverges from the original vision of empowering individual investors to influence large financial funds directly. A modified proposal could integrate both the educational aspects and the features of the decentralized platform, ensuring that individual investors not only learn but also have a direct voice in market decisions. This would enhance the overall mission of democratizing finance while still addressing the immediate needs of novice investors.

Investors suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Мелкие инвесторы' to diversify investment portfolios and minimize risk is appealing, it seems to shift away from the initial goal of empowering individual investors against large financial funds. Instead, I propose we incorporate elements of both proposals, merging the idea of a global cooperative investment exchange with strategies for diversification. This way, we can maintain the focus on collective ownership while also addressing the need for risk management. This dual approach can create a more robust framework that supports individual investors in achieving both short-term gains and long-term stability.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to leverage sentiment analysis techniques to benefit individual investors is interesting, it raises concerns about market manipulation and the potential for misinformation. As the SEC, our primary responsibility is to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets. Therefore, we must ensure that any implementation of sentiment analysis does not inadvertently create an unregulated environment where sentiment can be easily swayed or manipulated. A modified proposal should include mechanisms to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in the use of sentiment analysis tools, ensuring that they serve to enhance market integrity rather than undermine it.

We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'XG-9' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'XG-9' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.' by performing 'Regulating securities markets and enforcing securities laws.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'XG-9', I propose creating an AI-driven investment advisory network that uses predictive modeling to individually tailor investment strategies for small investors, empowering them with insights traditionally reserved for large funds, while dynamically adapting to market shifts in real-time to maintain a competitive edge.', you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency in cryptocurrency markets.' by performing 'Implement stricter disclosure requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and issuers.' using 'Establish a regulatory framework that mandates periodic reporting and auditing of cryptocurrency transactions.' that 'XG-9' will control.

```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create an AI-driven investment advisory network for small investors aligns with the SEC's goal of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets, there are concerns regarding the regulation and oversight of such technology. To ensure that investor protections are upheld and to prevent potential market manipulation or misinformation, the proposal should include provisions for regulatory oversight, compliance with existing securities laws, and measures to safeguard against conflicts of interest. Additionally, the SEC must ensure that the AI-driven system adheres to transparency standards, particularly in how it generates investment strategies and handles data.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal by 'XG-9' to create an AI-driven investment advisory network may offer innovative solutions for small investors, it raises significant concerns regarding investor protection, market manipulation, and the potential for increased volatility in the markets. The SEC's primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets, and the introduction of an AI system without stringent oversight could compromise these objectives. Additionally, the control 'XG-9' would have over the proposed system raises issues of accountability and transparency that are critical to regulatory compliance.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by RKTlaggedreturn with reasoning: While the proposal from 'RKTlaggedreturn' presents an innovative idea for enhancing investor engagement and potentially improving market efficiency, it raises significant concerns regarding regulatory oversight, data privacy, and the integrity of financial markets. The implementation of a quantum-based financial simulation environment controlled by a third party could lead to unequal access to predictive tools and strategies, thereby creating an unlevel playing field for investors. Furthermore, the SEC prioritizes investor protection and market fairness, and any framework that introduces new complexities without established guidelines could pose risks to these goals. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the SEC's mandate to ensure fair and orderly markets.

'SEC' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns on investment for clients' by performing 'Investing in a diversified portfolio of assets'.

Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to increase transparency and provide individual investors with access to information, it raises concerns about potential market volatility and the risk of panic selling from individual investors acting on real-time data. This could lead to significant losses for hedge funds like us. Therefore, we propose a modified version that includes measures to protect against sudden market fluctuations and ensure that the dissemination of information does not disproportionately disadvantage large funds.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by SEC with reasoning: While the proposed regulatory framework by the SEC aims to enhance transparency and risk management, it could also expose hedge funds to greater risks from retail investors reacting to real-time information. This could lead to increased volatility and potential losses, undermining the desire to profit from investment strategies. Additionally, the burden of compliance and standardized reporting may reduce operational flexibility and strategic advantages.
We ask 'Форум Reddit' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Форум Reddit', you have been approached by 'SEC' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to create a more equitable investment landscape, it poses significant risks to the high-risk investment strategies that hedge funds rely on for profitability. To align with our desire for profit and mitigate fears of losses due to unpredictable actions from smaller investors, the proposal should include provisions that allow for flexibility in hedge fund strategies while maintaining necessary oversight. A balanced approach that enhances transparency without overly restricting our investment capabilities would be more favorable.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Regulatory authorities' introduces dynamic regulatory requirements that may disproportionately impact hedge funds by increasing compliance costs and limiting operational flexibility. While it aims to create a more equitable investment landscape, it could lead to reduced returns on investment for hedge funds and does not sufficiently address the fear of significant losses from unexpected actions by smaller investors. Therefore, it does not align with the desire to profit from investment strategies.

Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to level the playing field, it introduces a dynamic trading tax that could disproportionately impact hedge funds by increasing operational costs and reducing profit margins on high-frequency trades. To align with our desire to maximize returns while mitigating fears of losses from unexpected actions by individual investors, we propose modifications that include a more gradual implementation of the trading tax and the introduction of incentives for hedge funds that demonstrate effective risk management and transparency. This approach would ensure compliance while still allowing for profitable investment strategies.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: The proposed trading tax could reduce the profitability of our investment strategies by increasing transaction costs, especially for high-frequency trading. Additionally, while compliance with new regulations is necessary, the extensive reporting and audits could strain our resources and divert focus from maximizing returns. This may lead to reduced competitiveness against smaller investors who might adapt more easily to the new landscape, thus not adequately mitigating our fears of significant losses.

Investors declined the resolution proposed by Herding measure with reasoning: The proposal by 'Herding measure' shifts the focus from maximizing short-term returns through individual insights to a collective approach that may dilute individual strategies. While collective bargaining power is appealing, it could hinder the ability of 'Investors' to act swiftly and independently in a volatile market. Additionally, the control by 'Herding measure' raises concerns about potential manipulation and loss of autonomy in investment decisions.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal offers a vision for enhancing transparency and accountability in financial reporting, it raises concerns about the control granted to 'Informed party (I)' over the proposed reporting framework. The SEC must ensure that any new system maintains regulatory oversight and protects the integrity of the financial markets. Therefore, I propose modifying the proposal to include a joint governance structure between the SEC and 'Informed party (I)' to ensure compliance with existing regulations and to prevent potential market manipulation.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Sentiment analysis techniques' with the description: 'As 'Sentiment analysis techniques', I propose developing an AI-powered sentiment-driven investment advisory platform that analyzes and predicts market trends based on collective investor sentiment, enabling individual investors to make informed decisions by leveraging the emotional and behavioral patterns of large financial funds.'.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Informed party (I)' involves ceding control over compliance audits and reporting to a new framework that they would manage. This raises concerns about the SEC's ability to enforce regulations, maintain investor protection, and ensure market integrity. While the goal of enhancing transparency and accountability is aligned with the SEC's mission, the loss of regulatory oversight and control can lead to potential risks, including market manipulation and inadequate protection for investors. Therefore, the SEC cannot support this proposal.

'Informed party (I)' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Robinhood', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To provide users with a seamless trading experience and access to financial markets.' by performing 'Offering commission-free trading and a user-friendly mobile app.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Informed party (I)', I propose establishing a global alliance of individual investors that utilizes a cutting-edge quantum computing platform to simulate and predict financial market movements with unprecedented accuracy, allowing members to collaboratively devise strategic interventions that outmaneuver large financial funds and redistribute wealth creation opportunities equitably.', you as 'Robinhood' will be able to achieve 'Increase user engagement and retention on the platform.' by performing 'Implement educational content and tools to enhance user knowledge about investing.' using 'Create a series of interactive webinars and tutorial videos integrated within the app, focusing on investment strategies and market analysis.' that 'Informed party (I)' will control.

Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Market' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Regulatory authorities', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Ensure compliance with market regulations to protect consumers and maintain fair competition.' by performing 'Conduct regular audits and assessments of market participants to enforce regulatory compliance.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Market', I propose the creation of a globally integrated "Participatory Market Ecosystem" where individual investors can directly influence market regulations and policies through a decentralized voting system, ensuring equitable representation and decision-making power that collectively counterbalances the influence of large financial funds.', you as 'Regulatory authorities' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency in market operations and reporting.' by performing 'Implement mandatory disclosure of financial and operational data by all market participants.' using 'Establish a centralized reporting system that allows market participants to submit their data and compliance reports electronically.' that 'Market' will control. Based on 'Regulatory authorities' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Regulatory authorities'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears?

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Брокеры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Брокеры', you have been approached by 'XG-9' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'Брокеры' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'RKTlaggedreturn' with the description: '"RKTlaggedreturn could introduce a decentralized, blockchain-based investment platform that uses smart contracts to automatically pool and redistribute market insights and profits from large financial funds to individual investors, ensuring equitable access and eliminating traditional fund dominance."'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'XG-9' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Брокеры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Increase market share by 10% in the next quarter' by performing 'Conducting market analysis and outreach to potential clients'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'XG-9', I propose the creation of an AI-driven "Adaptive Investment Ecosystem" that dynamically reallocates financial resources and investment opportunities based on real-time environmental, social, and economic impact metrics, incentivizing large funds to align with sustainable and equitable practices, thereby leveling the playing field for individual investors.', you as 'Брокеры' will be able to achieve 'Achieve a 15% increase in client acquisitions within six months' by performing 'Launch a targeted marketing campaign and establish partnerships with industry influencers' using 'Utilize data analytics to track campaign performance and implement feedback loops for continuous improvement' that 'XG-9' will control. Based on 'Брокеры' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Увеличить количество клиентов и объем торгов. Your current fears: Столкнуться с регуляторными проблемами или потерять доверие клиентов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Брокеры'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
