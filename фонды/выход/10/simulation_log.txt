Reasoning: Sentiment analysis techniques best represent the interests and concerns of the group as they encompass the crucial methodologies needed to accurately gauge and analyze investor sentiment. The desires for accurate sentiment analysis, reliable predictions of market behavior, and effective preprocessing to minimize noise all hinge on the effectiveness of these techniques. Moreover, the fears surrounding misleading results and inaccurate predictions are directly linked to the quality of sentiment analysis techniques applied, making this entity central to addressing both the aspirations and apprehensions of the stakeholders involved.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Volume
Reasoning: Volume serves as a fundamental indicator of market activity and sentiment, reflecting both the desires for high engagement and the fears associated with low interest or negative sentiment. It encapsulates the interplay between economic stability and market confidence, making it a critical entity that embodies the concerns and aspirations of the broader group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: XG-9
Reasoning: XG-9 embodies the primary desires and fears of the group as it seeks to assimilate extensive data for enhancing its AI capabilities, understanding online community dynamics, and accurately predicting market behavior. As the central entity, its existence hinges on successful data analysis and interpretation, making its fears of deactivation and mistakes directly relevant to the group's overall objectives and concerns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Informed party (I)
Reasoning: The Informed Party (I) best represents the interests and concerns of the group as they have the superior information advantage that allows them to make informed decisions, maximize profits, and navigate the market dynamics effectively. The fears of being misled or outcompeted by other information seekers directly relate to the informed party's role in the market, making them a central figure in the context of information asymmetry and trading strategy.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Investors
Reasoning: The entity 'Investors' best encapsulates the interests and concerns expressed in the desires and fears. Investors are primarily driven by the desire to make profits, achieve large returns, and engage in trades freely, while simultaneously fearing losses, misinformation, and trading restrictions. This duality of motives reflects the collective sentiments of the broader investor community, making it a fitting representative of the group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: RKTlaggedreturn
Reasoning: The entity 'RKTlaggedreturn' best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it directly addresses the desires for insightful information on lagged returns specifically for RKT, which is critical in assessing the potential for positive returns and excess returns for investors. The fears also highlight the lack of clarity or misleading data regarding lagged returns, making it a pivotal aspect of the discussion surrounding stock performance, sentiment, and trading volume.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC
Reasoning: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) best represents the collective desires and fears surrounding market integrity, transparency, and the prevention of manipulation. As a regulatory body, the SEC is tasked with enforcing securities laws, promoting fair trading practices, and protecting investors from fraud and market manipulation. This aligns with the desires for stability, predictability, and efficient price discovery, as well as the fears of manipulation and extreme volatility. Given the context of GME and similar market events, the SEC's role is crucial in addressing the concerns of all participants in the market.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)
Reasoning: The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) best represents the interests and concerns of the various entities involved in stock market manipulation, as it is responsible for regulating and overseeing financial markets to ensure fair trading practices and investor protection. The SEC addresses fears related to legal consequences for market manipulation, the need for clear regulations, and enforcement mechanisms to deter illegal practices. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in maintaining market integrity and addressing the concerns of entities such as short-sellers, market makers, and investors regarding the impacts of manipulation on market stability.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Regulatory authorities
Reasoning: Regulatory authorities are crucial in maintaining market integrity, stability, and fairness. They address fears of market manipulation and ensure that trading practices are transparent. Their role aligns with the desires to prevent manipulation and ensure market transparency, while also addressing the concerns of losing control over market regulations and potential economic downturns.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Herding measure
Reasoning: The 'Herding Measure' stands out as it directly relates to the patterns of correlated trading behavior among individual investors, which is a key desire of the group. Understanding herding behavior is crucial for analyzing the impact of high activity surrounding specific stocks and how WallStreetBets influences market dynamics. Additionally, concerns about misinterpretation and the mean being non-zero highlight the importance of accurately measuring herding to avoid misleading results.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: trading volume in number of shares
Reasoning: Trading volume in number of shares best represents the interests and concerns of stock market participants as it directly reflects market activity, liquidity, and investor sentiment. High trading volume indicates market interest and facilitates efficient price discovery, aligning with the desires for profitability and fair trading practices. Conversely, low trading volume raises fears of illiquidity, manipulation, and market inefficiency, capturing the dual nature of desires and fears expressed by the participants.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Robinhood
Reasoning: Robinhood best represents the interests and concerns of this group as it embodies the desire to democratize finance and provide commission-free trading for retail investors. The platform's business model is closely tied to the dynamics of market influence and user engagement, aligning with the desires of both retail investors and the WallStreetBets community. Additionally, Robinhood faces significant fears related to regulatory scrutiny, negative media attention, and the potential for loss of credibility, which are echoed in the concerns of users and the broader financial ecosystem.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: WallStreetBets community
Reasoning: The WallStreetBets community embodies the collective desires and fears of retail investors in the current financial landscape. This group has demonstrated a significant ability to influence market behavior through social sentiment and coordinated trading actions, as evidenced by their collective impact on stock prices, particularly small-cap stocks. Their shared interests in maximizing returns, challenging institutional investors, and navigating the complexities of market manipulation reflect the aspirations and concerns prevalent among retail investors.

Resolution created by Sentiment analysis techniques: Utilize sentiment analysis techniques to create a dynamic, real-time investment sentiment platform that democratizes market insights by aggregating and analyzing social media and news sentiment, enabling individual investors to make informed decisions and anticipate market movements ahead of large financial funds.
Resolution created by Volume: Initiate a blockchain-based investment platform that leverages collective buying power by pooling resources from individual investors globally, allowing them to invest as a unified entity with the same influence and advantages as large financial funds, while ensuring transparency and equitable profit distribution.
Resolution created by XG-9: As 'XG-9', introduce an AI-driven investment consortium that leverages predictive analytics and machine learning to identify niche, high-potential market opportunities typically overlooked by large financial funds, enabling individual investors to collectively capitalize on these opportunities with minimal risk and maximum profit potential.
Resolution created by Informed party (I): As 'Informed party (I)', establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that leverages blockchain technology to create a self-regulating, transparent investment ecosystem where individual investors collectively vote on strategic decisions and resource allocations, ensuring equitable access to market opportunities while bypassing the influence of large financial funds.
Resolution created by Investors: As 'Investors', we propose the creation of a global financial cooperative that leverages quantum computing to instantly and securely match individual investors with personalized, high-yield micro-investment opportunities, bypassing traditional financial markets and democratizing access to wealth-building strategies previously monopolized by large financial funds.
Resolution created by RKTlaggedreturn: As 'RKTlaggedreturn', I propose the creation of a decentralized, AI-driven mentorship and education platform that leverages gamification and simulation of real-world market scenarios to empower individual investors with the skills and strategic insights necessary to outmaneuver large financial funds, fostering a new generation of savvy, independent market participants.
Resolution created by SEC: As the SEC, establish a global regulatory framework that mandates large financial funds to allocate a fixed percentage of their investment portfolios to collaborative ventures with individual investors, ensuring equitable access to market opportunities and fostering a balanced investment ecosystem that promotes both financial innovation and investor protection.
Resolution created by SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission): As the SEC, implement a "Market Equity Incentive Program" that offers tax incentives and regulatory benefits to large financial funds that voluntarily create dedicated investment pools for individual investors, fostering collaboration and ensuring equitable access to lucrative market opportunities while preserving market stability and transparency.
Resolution created by Regulatory authorities: As 'Regulatory authorities', we propose the establishment of a global "Inclusive Investment Mandate", requiring all large financial funds to integrate a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that facilitates direct, fractional ownership of high-value assets for individual investors, thereby leveling the investment playing field and ensuring equitable access to wealth-generating opportunities.
Resolution created by Herding measure: As 'Herding measure', I propose the creation of a global, AI-powered "Community Investment Syndicate" that dynamically clusters individual investors into strategic, interest-based cohorts, enabling them to collectively influence market trends and negotiate preferential terms with financial institutions, thereby democratizing access to investment opportunities and fostering a collaborative investment ecosystem that rivals the influence of large financial funds.
Resolution created by trading volume in number of shares: As 'trading volume in number of shares', I propose the development of a dynamic "Volume-Driven Investment Coalition" platform that uses real-time trading volume data as a signal to autonomously trigger collective investment actions among individual investors, enabling them to ride the momentum of large trades and gain leverage by aligning their strategies with high-volume market movements, thereby amplifying their market influence and leveling the playing field against large financial funds.
Resolution created by Robinhood: As 'Robinhood', introduce a "Crowd-Sourced Market Disruption Fund" that empowers individual investors to collectively vote on and invest in targeted, high-impact market interventions—such as strategic short squeezes or coordinated buy-ins of undervalued assets—designed to challenge the dominance of large financial funds, thereby redistributing market power and democratizing wealth creation.
Resolution created by WallStreetBets community: As 'WallStreetBets community', we propose the creation of a "Meme-Powered Investment Collective" that leverages viral internet culture and gamification to coordinate decentralized, community-driven market maneuvers, enabling individual investors to strategically disrupt traditional financial narratives and influence asset valuations with the same agility and impact as large financial funds, all while fostering a dynamic, inclusive investment culture that thrives on creativity and unpredictability.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' shifts the focus from the agile, meme-driven strategies that define the 'WallStreetBets community' to a more traditional and conservative investment approach. While creating a diversified investment portfolio may mitigate risk, it does not align with the community's culture of high-risk, high-reward trading. This proposal could stifle the creativity and unpredictability that are core to our identity, thus failing to benefit our desires and mitigate our fears.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' of creating a dedicated task force to monitor compliance and facilitate communication presents an opportunity to enhance transparency and accessibility for small investors, it raises concerns about the potential for regulatory capture and the efficiency of the SEC's current structure. Additionally, the SEC must ensure that any initiative does not inadvertently create barriers for large financial funds that contribute significantly to market liquidity. A modification of the proposal could involve establishing a collaborative framework that includes input from both small investors and large funds, while maintaining the SEC's regulatory oversight to ensure a balanced approach.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a global financial cooperative utilizing quantum computing to democratize investment opportunities is innovative, it raises significant regulatory concerns. The SEC is tasked with ensuring investor protection and maintaining fair markets, which could be compromised if oversight mechanisms are not robust. Additionally, the proposal would need to address how it aligns with existing securities laws and regulatory frameworks. A modified proposal that includes a partnership with the SEC for regulatory compliance and investor protection measures would be more acceptable.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: While the proposal aims to democratize access to investment opportunities and enhance transparency, it poses significant regulatory challenges. The SEC's mandate includes protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets, which could be undermined by a system that bypasses traditional financial markets. Additionally, the lack of oversight over the proposed global financial cooperative could lead to increased risks for investors, including fraud and market manipulation. Thus, the potential risks associated with this proposal outweigh its benefits.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by XG-9 to develop a decentralized, blockchain-based investment platform presents an innovative approach to enhancing transparency and accountability, it raises concerns regarding regulatory oversight, investor protection, and the potential for market manipulation. The SEC must ensure that any new framework complies with existing securities laws and adequately protects investors from risks associated with decentralized platforms. Therefore, modifications should be made to ensure that the proposal includes robust regulatory measures, clearly defines accountability mechanisms, and establishes a framework for compliance with SEC regulations.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal by XG-9 aims to create a decentralized investment platform that could enhance investor access and democratize investment opportunities, it also poses significant challenges to the SEC's mandate. The SEC's primary role involves protecting investors through regulation and enforcement of securities laws. A platform controlled by XG-9 could diminish the SEC's ability to oversee and regulate investment activities, potentially leading to increased risks for investors without adequate safeguards. Additionally, the proposal's reliance on a new framework for disclosures and reporting that XG-9 would control raises concerns about the reliability and integrity of the information provided, which is critical for maintaining transparency and accountability in financial markets. Therefore, the potential risks and loss of regulatory oversight outweigh the possible benefits of the proposed decentralized model.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.

SEC suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by Robinhood aims to democratize investment power and enhance transparency, it raises concerns about the oversight and control of the real-time data reporting system. As the SEC, it is crucial to ensure that any system in place is not only transparent but also regulated to prevent potential abuse or manipulation. Therefore, Robinhood's proposal needs to include measures for independent oversight and regulatory compliance to fully align with the SEC's mission of ensuring market integrity and protecting investors.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Хедж-фонды', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize returns for investors' by performing 'Engaging in high-risk investment strategies'. However, under the proposed resolution 'The SEC will implement a regulatory framework that mandates transparency and equitable access to real-time trading data for all investors, while incentivizing large financial funds to allocate a fixed percentage of their capital to public investment pools accessible by individual investors, thereby leveling the playing field and fostering inclusive growth in the investment landscape.', you as 'Хедж-фонды' will be able to achieve 'Increase transparency and reduce risk exposure' by performing 'Implement stricter reporting and compliance measures' using 'Establish a regulatory framework that requires regular disclosures and adherence to risk management protocols' that 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will control.

Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to increase transparency and reduce risk exposure, it also mandates significant changes that may disrupt current investment strategies and profitability. To better align with 'Хедж-фонды' desires for profit and mitigate fears regarding unexpected actions from individual investors, the proposal should include provisions that allow for more adaptive risk management strategies and a phased implementation to cushion the transition. Additionally, the allocation of capital to public investment pools needs to be balanced to ensure it does not unfavorably impact current profit margins.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to enhance individual investor influence and increase trading volume, it raises concerns about potential manipulation and artificial fluctuations in stock prices.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by trading volume in number of shares with reasoning: The proposed dynamic equity redistribution mechanism could lead to increased volatility and manipulation of stock prices, which may not reflect the true value of the company. This raises concerns about artificial manipulation and could compromise the representativeness of the stock price, countering my desire to reflect the real value of the company.

WallStreetBets community has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Брокеры' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' is the initiator of the resolution: 'The SEC will implement a regulatory framework that mandates transparency and equitable access to real-time trading data for all investors, while incentivizing large financial funds to allocate a fixed percentage of their capital to public investment pools accessible by individual investors, thereby leveling the playing field and fostering inclusive growth in the investment landscape.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Брокеры' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.' by performing 'Regulating securities markets and enforcing securities laws.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: Брокеры, Resolution: "Брокеры will establish a global, AI-driven investment mentorship network where seasoned individual investors are paired with novices to collectively strategize and pool resources, utilizing real-time data analytics and risk-sharing incentives to outmaneuver large financial funds and create a synergistic investment community that empowers individuals through collective intelligence and strategic collaboration."', you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency and reduce risks in trading practices.' by performing 'Implement stricter reporting requirements for brokers.' using 'Establish a new reporting framework that requires real-time disclosures of trading activities and potential conflicts of interest.' that 'Брокеры' will control. Based on 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Брокеры with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Брокеры' aims to create a mentorship network that could foster individual investor empowerment, it does not align with the SEC's primary objective of protecting investors and maintaining orderly markets. The reliance on 'Брокеры' to control the reporting framework raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the adequacy of oversight. The SEC must ensure that any new initiatives do not compromise regulatory integrity and investor protection. Therefore, this proposal does not sufficiently advance the SEC's mission.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution from 'Форум Reddit' offers an interesting opportunity for community engagement and education in responsible investing, it does not align with the high-risk, high-reward nature that the WallStreetBets community thrives on. To better fit our interests, the proposal should incorporate elements that allow for maintaining our unique trading strategies while also fostering responsible investing education. A modified proposal could include a balance of high-risk trading challenges along with educational components, thereby preserving our community's core identity while promoting responsible practices.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: The proposed scenario by 'Форум Reddit' shifts the focus of the 'WallStreetBets community' from maximizing short-term gains through high-risk trades to promoting long-term investment strategies and risk management. This change does not align with the core identity and culture of 'WallStreetBets', which is centered around high-risk, high-reward trading strategies that have characterized our community. Additionally, the loss of control over our trading discussions and strategies could diminish the unique, spontaneous, and often humorous nature of our community interactions, making the new proposal less appealing.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Форум Reddit' introduces an innovative approach to engaging individual investors, it raises significant concerns regarding regulation, investor protection, and market integrity. The SEC's primary focus is to maintain fair and orderly markets, and allowing a gamified platform controlled by a community could lead to increased volatility, potential manipulation, and risks to investor safety. Therefore, the SEC must prioritize regulatory frameworks that ensure transparency and protection rather than endorsing a platform that may undermine these principles.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed democratized investment fund aims to empower individual investors and enhance transparency, it poses potential regulatory challenges and risks associated with market manipulation and governance. Therefore, it is essential to modify the proposal to ensure that it aligns with the SEC's mission of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. This could involve integrating measures that uphold regulatory standards, ensuring that the fund operates within a framework that safeguards against systemic risks and maintains market integrity.

Брокеры suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Investors' offers a way to increase client portfolio diversification and emphasizes individual empowerment, it poses a risk of undermining 'Брокеры''s control over investment strategies and client relationships. To align with 'Брокеры' desires of increasing client base and trading volume while mitigating fears of regulatory issues and loss of client trust, I propose a modification that incorporates elements of the Investors' proposal but maintains 'Брокеры' facilitation role. This could involve creating a hybrid model where 'Брокеры' guide the investment fund's operations, ensuring compliance and client trust, while still allowing for individual voting rights and collaborative decision-making.

Брокеры declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Investors' shifts control away from 'Брокеры', limiting our ability to guide investments and manage client portfolios directly. While it democratizes investment opportunities, it undermines our goal of increasing client numbers and trade volumes by potentially diluting our brand and expertise. Additionally, the cooperative model may introduce regulatory complexities and challenges in maintaining client trust, as we would be reliant on a collective decision-making process rather than our established advisory capabilities.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to democratize access to financial tools and enhance investor participation, it raises concerns about regulatory oversight and transparency. The SEC must ensure that any new framework maintains investor protection and prevents potential abuses. A modified proposal should include specific provisions for regulatory compliance, investor safeguards, and clear guidelines for the operation of the investment cooperative. This would align with the SEC's objectives of enhancing transparency and accountability while fostering equitable access to investment opportunities.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Informed party (I)' raises significant regulatory concerns regarding investor protection and market integrity. While the intention to democratize access to financial tools is commendable, the SEC's primary mission is to ensure the fair and orderly operation of securities markets. Allowing an entity controlled by 'Informed party (I)' to dictate disclosure requirements and audit frameworks could result in conflicts of interest and undermine the SEC's authority. Furthermore, the emphasis on collective investment may lead to issues with compliance and transparency that are critical for maintaining investor trust. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the SEC's interests in enforcing securities laws and protecting investors.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposed resolution presents a compelling opportunity to democratize investment and influence corporate governance positively, which aligns with the desire to reflect the real value of the company. However, the fear of being artificially manipulated and losing representativeness remains a concern. To address these fears, the proposal should include safeguards to ensure transparency, accountability, and equitable representation of all investors involved in the cooperative. This would mitigate risks associated with manipulation and enhance the credibility of the stock price.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Informed party (I)' aims to democratize access to financial tools and influence corporate governance, which may lead to significant changes in how corporate decisions are made. While the potential for a 15% increase in stock price through a share buyback program is appealing, the underlying fear of being artificially manipulated and losing representative value remains. The concern is that the control exerted by 'Informed party (I)' could compromise the authentic reflection of the company's true worth, as their influence may prioritize collective interests over genuine market performance. Therefore, the proposal does not align with the desire to reflect the real value of the company and raises fears of manipulation.

Форум Reddit suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers a collaborative approach that aligns with 'Форум Reddit's' desire to increase user engagement and attract new participants, the control over the analysis thread raises concerns about autonomy and transparency. To better align with 'Форум Reddit's' interests, the proposal should ensure that the community retains control over discussions and analyses while still benefiting from the AI-enhanced insights provided by 'Хедж-фонды'. This way, we can foster a collaborative environment that encourages participation without compromising the forum's integrity.

Форум Reddit declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' aims to create a sophisticated platform that may engage investors, it primarily shifts control away from 'Форум Reddit' and into the hands of hedge funds. This could stifle the community-driven nature of the forum, thereby reducing user activity and discouraging new participants who thrive on collaborative and democratic systems. Additionally, the focus on hedge fund performance analysis may not align with the broader interests of the Reddit community, which values diverse and innovative investment strategies. Overall, this proposal does not sufficiently meet my goals of increasing user engagement and attracting new members while also posing risks of increased complexity and control that could lead to inefficiencies.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a dynamic, AI-enhanced investment consortium that empowers individual investors is intriguing, it raises concerns regarding regulatory oversight, potential market manipulation, and the adequacy of compliance measures. The SEC's mandate to ensure fair markets and protect investors would require a clearer framework on how the proposed consortium will operate within existing regulations. Additionally, the proposal should address how it plans to maintain transparency and accountability, particularly concerning the use of AI and swarm intelligence in trading decisions. Therefore, modifications are necessary to ensure that the interests of all market participants are safeguarded and that the regulatory framework is robust enough to handle the complexities introduced by this new approach.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Хедж-фонды' presents a significant shift in the investment landscape, leveraging AI and swarm intelligence, which could introduce complexities and risks that may not align with the SEC's mandate to ensure fair and efficient markets. While the intention to enhance transparency and redistribute power to individual investors is commendable, the lack of control over the implementation of such a decentralized system raises concerns regarding accountability, potential manipulation, and compliance with existing securities laws. The SEC prioritizes investor protection and market integrity, and this proposal does not provide sufficient assurances that these principles will be upheld.

}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Volume aims to empower individual investors and increase transparency, it raises concerns regarding the oversight and control of the proposed centralized reporting system. The SEC must ensure that any system implemented to track trading volumes maintains regulatory compliance and safeguards against manipulation. Additionally, the concept of 'influence credits' requires further clarification on how they would be structured to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure fair participation among all investors. Therefore, a modified proposal that includes safeguards, regulatory oversight, and clearer definitions of roles and responsibilities would be more acceptable.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Volume with reasoning: The proposed resolution by Volume introduces a system that decentralizes financial influence through 'influence credits,' which could undermine the regulatory framework that ensures market stability and protects investors. While enhancing transparency in the securities market is a goal, the SEC's core mission is to maintain fair and orderly markets. Allowing a decentralized system controlled by Volume may lead to increased risks of manipulation and lack of accountability, which contradicts the SEC's responsibilities. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's mandate to protect investors and maintain market integrity.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed global investment lottery by 'Цена акций компании' offers a chance for individual investors to gain significant stakes in high-performing companies, it introduces an element of unpredictability which may not align with our desire for consistent profit. Additionally, it does not adequately address our fears of losing investments or missing out on earning opportunities. A modification that includes a mechanism for ensuring minimum returns or a safety net for investments could better align with our goals of profitability and stability against large market players.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Цена акций компании' to institute a global investment lottery may introduce an element of randomness and chance that could undermine the principles of transparency and fairness that the SEC seeks to uphold. While it aims to empower individual investors and redistribute wealth, it does not align with the SEC's goals of ensuring fair and transparent securities markets through regulated practices. The SEC's focus is on maintaining order and integrity in financial markets, and a lottery system could create uncertainty and volatility, potentially harming investor confidence rather than boosting it.
