SEC suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'Мелкие инвесторы' aims to enhance the participation of small investors, it is crucial for the SEC to maintain oversight and regulatory authority.

This ensures that small investors are empowered while maintaining the regulatory oversight necessary to prevent potential market manipulation or risks that could arise from unregulated activities.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a decentralized, gamified trading platform is intriguing, it primarily focuses on maximizing short-term gains through high-risk trades, which may not align with the long-term interests of the WallStreetBets community. By modifying the proposal to include a stronger emphasis on educational resources and diversification strategies, we can better balance the desire for high-risk trading with the need for risk management and sustainable investment practices. This approach would not only empower individual investors but also enhance the overall resilience of the community against large financial funds.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Мелкие инвесторы with reasoning: The new proposal by 'Мелкие инвесторы' focuses on long-term growth and diversification, which contrasts with the 'WallStreetBets community' ethos of short-term high-risk trading and meme-driven market disruption. This shift towards a more conservative approach undermines the community's identity and primary interest in engaging in speculative trading for immediate gains. The community thrives on the excitement and volatility of the current trading environment, and adopting a strategy centered on diversification would dilute its core values and appeal.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the integration of sentiment analysis techniques into the regulatory framework is intriguing, it raises concerns about the potential for misuse and the integrity of the information being disseminated. The SEC aims to ensure fair and efficient markets while protecting investors, and thus any proposal must ensure that these objectives are met without compromising regulatory oversight. A modified proposal that includes robust safeguards for data integrity, transparency in the use of sentiment analysis, and clear boundaries on how individual investors can utilize this information would be more aligned with the SEC's mandate.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Sentiment analysis techniques with reasoning: While the proposal to utilize sentiment analysis techniques for market monitoring offers an innovative approach to empower individual investors, it raises concerns about the SEC's ability to maintain regulatory oversight and protect proprietary information of large financial funds. The SEC's primary role is to ensure fair and efficient markets while safeguarding investors, and introducing an AI-driven platform controlled by external entities may compromise the integrity and security of market data.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to utilize sentiment analysis techniques offers a more structured approach to trading and could enhance the ability to predict market movements, it still leans heavily on traditional metrics and might dilute the community-driven, meme-centric ethos that defines the WallStreetBets community.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for a global, transparent investment education platform offers a compelling approach to empower individual investors and reduce reliance on large financial funds, it lacks a clear mechanism for regulatory oversight and investor protection. The SEC's primary objective is to ensure market integrity and protect investors. Therefore, I propose that the education platform be integrated with SEC guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure that it meets the necessary standards for transparency and accountability, thereby enhancing investor confidence and maintaining market integrity.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposed initiative by Informed party (I) focuses on creating an independent investment education platform, which while beneficial for individual investors, does not align with the SEC's primary mandate of regulating securities markets and enforcing securities laws. The SEC's role is to ensure fair and efficient markets, and while education is important, it does not provide the same level of regulatory oversight and investor protection that the SEC can enforce through the proposed GIEP initiative. Furthermore, ceding control over the reporting framework to Informed party (I) could undermine the SEC's authority and ability to ensure compliance with securities laws.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The proposal from 'Informed party (I)' significantly shifts the focus of the WallStreetBets community from maximizing short-term gains through high-risk investments to adopting a diversified investment strategy that emphasizes safer, long-term investments. This change does not align with the community's established approach and could diminish the excitement and engagement that characterizes WallStreetBets. Additionally, the reliance on a controlled educational platform may hinder the community's organic and spontaneous nature, which thrives on meme stocks and options trading. Therefore, while the proposal aims to empower individual investors, it does not resonate with the current desires and interests of the WallStreetBets community.

Resolution created by Форум Reddit: Форум Reddit can resolve the issue by creating a community-driven investment cooperative where individual investors pool resources to collectively negotiate better trading terms, access exclusive market insights, and leverage the power of social consensus to influence market trends and counteract the dominance of large financial funds.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: While the proposed resolution from 'Форум Reddit' aims to empower individual investors and increase transparency, it raises concerns about the potential for collective decision-making to lead to unpredictable market actions. This could result in significant losses for 'Хедж-фонды' due to the erratic behavior of a large group of small investors. Additionally, the control of performance reporting by 'Форум Reddit' might hinder the strategic flexibility that 'Хедж-фонды' require to maximize returns. Therefore, the proposal does not align with our primary goal of profit maximization while adequately addressing our fears of losses.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'Форум Reddit' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.' by performing 'Regulating securities exchanges and enforcing federal securities laws.'.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposal from 'Форум Reddit' presents an innovative approach to empower individual investors and challenge the dominance of large financial funds. However, it is essential to ensure that any community-driven investment cooperative operates within a framework that safeguards against potential risks such as fraud, lack of transparency, and regulatory compliance. The SEC's primary goal is to protect investors and maintain fair markets, so while the concept is intriguing, it requires modifications to ensure that adequate investor protections, transparency, and compliance measures are incorporated into the cooperative's structure. This would include establishing clear regulatory guidelines for the cooperative's operations and ensuring that it aligns with existing securities laws.
We ask 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. 'Форум Reddit' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.' by performing 'Regulating securities markets and enforcing federal securities laws.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Форум Reddit can resolve the issue by creating a community-driven investment cooperative where individual investors pool resources to collectively negotiate better trading terms, access exclusive market insights, and leverage the power of social consensus to influence market trends and counteract the dominance of large financial funds.', you as 'SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency and accountability in cryptocurrency markets.' by performing 'Implement comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs).' using 'Establish a regulatory framework that includes registration requirements, disclosure obligations, and regular audits for cryptocurrency entities.' that 'Форум Reddit' will control.

}
```.'
SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) declined the resolution proposed by Форум Reddit with reasoning: While the proposed community-driven investment cooperative may enhance individual investor participation, it poses significant challenges to the SEC's mandate of protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. The SEC must ensure that all participants adhere to federal securities laws, and a self-regulated cooperative could complicate enforcement and oversight. Additionally, there is a risk that such a cooperative could lead to market manipulation or misinformation, undermining transparency and accountability in the markets. Therefore, the SEC cannot support a structure that may inadvertently expose investors to greater risks without proper regulatory oversight.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Форум Reddit' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'RKTlaggedreturn' with the description: 'RKTlaggedreturn can resolve the issue by developing a decentralized, blockchain-based investment platform that democratizes access to exclusive financial data and tools, empowering individual investors to harness advanced analytics and collective intelligence to effectively compete with large financial funds.'.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a community-driven investment cooperative aligns with the WallStreetBets community's desire to counteract the dominance of large financial funds, it may also limit the high-risk trading strategies that the community is known for. To better serve the interests of the WallStreetBets community, the proposal should incorporate a balance between encouraging sustainable investment practices and maintaining the freedom to engage in high-risk trades. This can be achieved by allowing for both short-term and long-term investment discussions, ensuring that members can still pursue their traditional strategies while also benefiting from educational resources.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed AI-powered investment collective offers a technologically advanced approach to capitalize on market inefficiencies, it does not align with the WallStreetBets community's core values of engagement, risk-taking, and the social aspect of investing. The community thrives on discussions, memes, and high-risk strategies rather than algorithmic trading. Therefore, we propose to retain the community-driven aspect while incorporating elements of the AI system to enhance our trading strategies without losing our unique identity.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by Robinhood aims to empower individual investors and could potentially lead to an increase in stock prices, it raises concerns about the artificial manipulation of stock values and may not accurately reflect the true value of the company. To align with my desire to reflect the real value of the company and mitigate fears of being artificially manipulated, I suggest incorporating mechanisms that ensure transparency and validate the authenticity of investment strategies within the gamified platform.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Robinhood with reasoning: The proposal from 'Robinhood' emphasizes a gamified investment platform and AI-driven education, which may attract individual investors and create a competitive environment. However, this approach risks distorting the true market value of the company ('Цена акций компании'). The focus on gamification could lead to artificial manipulation of stock prices rather than reflecting the genuine performance of the company. This could undermine the desire to reflect the real value of the company and exacerbate fears of losing representativeness in the market.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by Robinhood to launch a gamified investment platform focusing on long-term investment strategies and financial literacy is appealing, it significantly shifts the focus away from the core interests of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on short-term trading and meme stocks. To align better with our community's culture, the proposal should integrate elements of both short-term trading strategies and community-driven discussions on meme stocks while still promoting financial literacy. This way, we can retain our unique identity and continue to engage in the types of trading that define us, while also benefiting from educational opportunities.

Мелкие инвесторы suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers potential benefits for 'Мелкие инвесторы' by increasing access to hedge funds and advanced financial tools, it raises concerns about control and transparency. 'Мелкие инвесторы' desire to profit and compete with large players, but fear losing their investments and missing out on earnings. To align better with our interests, the proposal should include provisions that ensure independent oversight of the hedge funds and guarantee that individual investors retain a degree of autonomy in managing their portfolios, as well as access to educational resources that empower them to make informed decisions.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers a pathway to increase investment in hedge funds and access to advanced financial tools, it compromises the core desire of 'Мелкие инвесторы' to achieve profits and compete with large players. The requirement to allocate a minimum of 20% of the total portfolio to hedge funds may expose 'Мелкие инвесторы' to greater risks, which contradicts the fear of losing investments. Moreover, the control of the guided investment strategy by 'Хедж-фонды' raises concerns about the autonomy and interests of 'Мелкие инвесторы', making the proposal less appealing.

SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Хедж-фонды' offers the potential for diversification and access to advanced tools, it appears to prioritize long-term stability at the expense of the high-risk, high-reward trading strategies that are favored by the 'WallStreetBets community'. To align with our community's interests and maintain our identity, we propose a hybrid approach where we can still engage in high-risk trades while having the option to explore long-term investments. This would allow for both the thrill of short-term trading and the security of long-term holdings, fostering a more balanced investment strategy.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy.

```.'
WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Хедж-фонды with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Хедж-фонды' focuses on long-term investment strategies and mitigating risks, which diverges from the core ethos of the 'WallStreetBets community'. The community thrives on high-risk, high-reward meme stock trading and the excitement of quick gains. The introduction of a structured, controlled environment with portfolio adjustments contradicts the community's desire for a more spontaneous and risk-driven investment approach. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the community's interests and objectives.
We ask 'Брокеры' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Брокеры', you have been approached by 'Хедж-фонды' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. 'Хедж-фонды' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Брокеры', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize client investment returns' by performing 'Executing trades and managing portfolios'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Хедж-фонды can resolve the issue by establishing a global "Investment Innovation Lab" that partners with academic institutions and tech startups to develop open-source financial models and tools, enabling individual investors to access cutting-edge strategies, predictive analytics, and customized portfolio solutions that rival those of large financial funds.', you as 'Брокеры' will be able to achieve 'Increase overall market liquidity' by performing 'Engage in high-frequency trading strategies' using 'Implement automated trading systems to facilitate rapid transactions' that 'Хедж-фонды' will control.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Herding measure with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Herding measure' offers an interesting approach to promoting long-term sustainable investment strategies, it does not address the immediate desire of 'Мелкие инвесторы' to achieve profits and counter the influence of large financial players in the short term. The introduction of a 'Market Sentiment Index' may provide insights, but it seems to shift the focus away from quick gains in trending stocks, which is currently desired.

WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Herding measure' presents a shift towards promoting long-term investment strategies and reducing herd mentality, which could foster a more sustainable investing environment, it diverges from the core values of the WallStreetBets community that thrives on high-risk trading and short-term profit maximization. The community is built on the excitement of speculative trading and social engagement, which may be stifled by an emphasis on due diligence and informed decision-making. Therefore, a modification is necessary to integrate elements that still allow for the high-risk trading culture while encouraging a more educated approach.

Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Цена акций компании with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Цена акций компании' introduces an innovative approach to empower individual investors through a 'Micro-Investment Swarm' system, it poses a significant risk to the stability and profitability of 'Хедж-фонды'. The decentralized nature of the proposed system could lead to unpredictable market behaviors that undermine 'Хедж-фонды' investment strategies. Additionally, the potential for high-frequency trading by a collective of individual investors could result in increased volatility, making it difficult for 'Хедж-фонды' to implement coordinated buying strategies effectively. Therefore, this proposal does not align with 'Хедж-фонды' desires to maximize returns and mitigate fears of significant losses.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal by XG-9 offers advanced predictive algorithms and a quantum-computing-driven ecosystem, it fundamentally shifts the focus from the WallStreetBets community's ethos of high-risk, high-reward trading strategies and community engagement in options trading. The proposed resolution emphasizes long-term investment strategies and financial literacy, which diverges from the community's current interests in maximizing short-term gains and engaging in high-frequency trading. Additionally, the control by XG-9 over the educational sessions may limit the community's autonomy and ability to share their unique insights and experiences, which are essential to the WallStreetBets culture.

Цена акций компании suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'trading volume in number of shares' offers a way to increase trading volume and potentially disrupt large financial funds, it does not directly address my desire to reflect the real value of the company. Additionally, there is a risk that the gamified system could lead to artificial trading behavior that may manipulate the stock price, thus exacerbating my fear of being manipulated and losing my representativeness. Therefore, I propose modifications to the initiative that ensure it aligns with maintaining the true market value while still incentivizing individual investors.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by trading volume in number of shares with reasoning: While the proposal from 'trading volume in number of shares' offers a potential increase in trading volume and liquidity, it raises significant concerns about the artificial manipulation of stock prices and the potential loss of representative value. The focus on gamification and volume-based rewards could lead to speculative trading behaviors that do not reflect the true value of the company. Therefore, this proposal does not align with my desire to reflect the real value of the company and does not adequately mitigate my fear of being manipulated and losing representativeness.

However, under the proposed resolution 'Regulatory authorities can resolve the issue by mandating a "Financial Fairness Framework" that enforces transparent algorithms for fund management and trading, requiring all large financial funds to periodically disclose their strategies and positions to a public blockchain, thereby leveling the informational playing field and empowering individual investors with equal access to market intelligence.', you as 'Хедж-фонды' will be able to achieve 'Enhance transparency and reduce systemic risk in the financial markets.' by performing 'Implement stricter reporting standards and risk assessment protocols.' using 'Establish a regulatory framework that mandates regular disclosures and compliance audits.' that 'Regulatory authorities' will control. Based on 'Хедж-фонды' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Получить прибыль от своих инвестиционных стратегий. Your current fears: Понести значительные убытки из-за неожиданных действий мелких инвесторов. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Хедж-фонды'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Хедж-фонды suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed 'Financial Fairness Framework' aims to enhance transparency and reduce systemic risk, it may also expose hedge funds to greater scrutiny and limit flexibility in trading strategies. This could lead to potential losses if small investors react unpredictably based on disclosed strategies. Therefore, it's crucial to modify the proposal to include provisions that protect hedge fund strategies while still promoting transparency, possibly by allowing certain proprietary information to remain confidential.
We ask 'Хедж-фонды' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Хедж-фонды', you have been approached by 'Regulatory authorities' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'Хедж-фонды' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Хедж-фонды can resolve the issue by establishing a global "Investment Innovation Lab" that partners with academic institutions and tech startups to develop open-source financial models and tools, enabling individual investors to access cutting-edge strategies, predictive analytics, and customized portfolio solutions that rival those of large financial funds.'.

}
```.'
Хедж-фонды declined the resolution proposed by Regulatory authorities with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Regulatory authorities' promotes transparency and compliance, it poses a risk to 'Хедж-фонды' by potentially exposing proprietary strategies and positions to the public. This could lead to increased competition from individual investors who gain access to sophisticated market intelligence, undermining the profitability of 'Хедж-фонды'. Additionally, the mandatory disclosure could cause volatility in the market as small investors react to the information, increasing the likelihood of unexpected losses for 'Хедж-фонды'. Thus, the proposal does not align with the desire to profit from investment strategies and fails to adequately mitigate the fear of significant losses.

Мелкие инвесторы has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'SEC' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Regulatory authorities' with the description: 'Regulatory authorities can resolve the issue by mandating a "Financial Fairness Framework" that enforces transparent algorithms for fund management and trading, requiring all large financial funds to periodically disclose their strategies and positions to a public blockchain, thereby leveling the informational playing field and empowering individual investors with equal access to market intelligence.'.

}
```.'
SEC declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Informed party (I)' aims to empower individual investors and enhance market transparency, it shifts control over the reporting framework to an external entity. This could undermine the SEC's regulatory authority and complicate the enforcement of compliance standards. The SEC's role in ensuring compliance and transparency is paramount, and relinquishing control could create inconsistencies and potential loopholes in regulation. Therefore, the SEC must prioritize maintaining its oversight capabilities over the proposed decentralized network.
We ask 'WallStreetBets community' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'WallStreetBets community', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'WallStreetBets community' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'trading volume in number of shares' with the description: 'Trading Volume in Number of Shares can resolve the issue by establishing a "Volume-Driven Market Dynamics Platform" that incentivizes individual investors through a gamified system of volume-based rewards and real-time feedback loops, leveraging collective trading activity to influence stock prices and create new liquidity pathways that disrupt the traditional dominance of large financial funds.'.

'Informed party (I)' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'WallStreetBets community', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Maximize short-term gains through high-risk stock trading.' by performing 'Participating in discussions and sharing stock tips on social media platforms.'.

}
```.'
WallStreetBets community suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed decentralized 'Investor Empowerment Network' presents an appealing opportunity for democratizing market access and potentially diversifying investment strategies, it may not fully align with the immediate interests and risk appetite of the WallStreetBets community. The community thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies characteristic of short-term trading. Therefore, the proposal should incorporate elements that still embrace high-risk trading while also providing avenues for diversification, such as a gamified system that rewards both short-term speculative trading and long-term investments.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: The WallStreetBets community thrives on high-risk, speculative trading, especially with meme stocks. The proposed resolution emphasizes a shift towards long-term investment strategies and the control of portfolio allocations by 'Informed party (I)', which directly conflicts with our current approach of maximizing short-term gains through high-risk trades. Additionally, the proposed decentralized network may dilute our community's unique identity and risk appetite, moving us away from the core excitement and engagement that defines WallStreetBets.
We ask 'XG-9' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'XG-9', you have been approached by 'Informed party (I)' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'XG-9' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Initiator: XG-9, Resolution: XG-9 can resolve the issue by developing a quantum-computing-driven financial ecosystem that leverages advanced predictive algorithms to simulate and pre-emptively navigate market scenarios, offering individual investors real-time strategic insights and automated decision-making capabilities that outpace and outmaneuver large financial funds, rendering XG-9 indispensable as the core facilitator of this revolutionary investment paradigm.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Informed party (I)' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'XG-9', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Complete the project on time' by performing 'Collaborating with team members to finalize the project plan'.

XG-9 declined the resolution proposed by Informed party (I) with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Informed party (I)' presents an innovative approach to democratizing investment access and empowering individual investors, it does not align with the core mission of 'XG-9' to leverage advanced predictive algorithms and quantum computing in the financial ecosystem. The current resolution focuses on enhancing decision-making capabilities through technology, which is distinct from the decentralized marketplace concept proposed. Accepting this proposal would undermine 'XG-9's' strategic vision and its role as a facilitator in the financial sector.

Мелкие инвесторы declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposed 'Global Investment Lottery' platform introduces a high degree of unpredictability and risk, which contradicts my current desire to achieve stable profits through low-risk securities. While it may offer a chance for a financial windfall, the uncertainty involved could lead to significant losses, heightening my fears of losing investments and missing out on earning opportunities. Therefore, this proposal does not align with my interests in maximizing returns while minimizing risk.

Цена акций компании declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposed decentralized 'Global Investment Lottery' platform does not align with my primary desire to reflect the real value of the company. While it may provide an unpredictable financial windfall opportunity, it does not contribute to the sustainable growth or stability of the stock price. Additionally, there is a risk that such a proposal could lead to further manipulation of the market and detract from the company's credibility, increasing my fear of being artificially manipulated and losing representativeness.
We ask 'SEC' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'SEC', you have been approached by 'Investors' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Крупные финансовые фонды лишают индивидуальных инвесторов возможности заработка'. Currently, 'SEC' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Regulatory authorities' with the description: 'Regulatory authorities can resolve the issue by mandating a "Financial Fairness Framework" that enforces transparent algorithms for fund management and trading, requiring all large financial funds to periodically disclose their strategies and positions to a public blockchain, thereby leveling the informational playing field and empowering individual investors with equal access to market intelligence.'.

SEC declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: While the proposed 'Global Investment Lottery' platform offers an innovative approach to democratizing investment opportunities, it poses significant regulatory challenges and risks for the SEC. The potential for misuse, lack of investor protection, and the unpredictability of such a lottery system could undermine the SEC's mandate to ensure compliance with securities regulations and protect investors. Additionally, it diverts focus from enhancing transparency in traditional financial disclosures, which is a core objective of the SEC. Therefore, this proposal does not align with the SEC's fundamental responsibilities and objectives.

WallStreetBets community declined the resolution proposed by Investors with reasoning: The proposed decentralized 'Global Investment Lottery' platform does not align with the interests of the WallStreetBets community, which thrives on high-risk investments and engaging discussions about volatile stocks. While the idea of pooling investments may provide some unpredictability, it undermines the community's strength in leveraging collective action and knowledge to drive specific stock movements. Additionally, the lack of control over the investment strategies and the focus on ESG stocks may dilute the community's core identity and goals, which center around maximizing returns through aggressive trading rather than socially responsible investing.
