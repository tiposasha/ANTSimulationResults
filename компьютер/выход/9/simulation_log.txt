Разработчики программного обеспечения declined the resolution proposed by Производитель компьютеров with reasoning: The proposal from 'Производитель компьютеров' may offer some innovative aspects, but it does not align with the core desires of 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' to create applications cost-effectively for a broad audience. Additionally, the dependency on 'Производитель компьютеров' for hardware specifications and updates introduces a risk of losing control over the development process, which heightens the fear of losing investments due to potential incompatibilities or rapid changes in the platform. The shift to a bio-integrated computing framework could complicate software development and compatibility, making it harder to achieve low-cost solutions.
