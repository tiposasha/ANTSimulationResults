Производители стандартизированных компонентов agreed to participate in the resolution proposed by IBM
We ask 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Разработчики программного обеспечения', you have been approached by 'IBM' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Конфликт между стандартизацией и контролем в технологических индустриях'. Currently, 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Производитель компьютеров' with the description: 'Задействовать внешнюю архитектуру комплектующих'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'IBM' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Разработчики программного обеспечения', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Develop innovative software solutions that meet client needs' by performing 'Collaborating with clients to gather requirements and feedback'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: IBM, Resolution: "Develop an AI-driven, open-source consortium platform that uses quantum computing to dynamically optimize and harmonize global standardization protocols in real-time, enabling seamless interoperability and innovation while maintaining robust oversight across technological industries."', you as 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' will be able to achieve 'Enhance software security features to meet industry standards' by performing 'Implement a new security framework and conduct regular audits' using 'Provide training sessions on security best practices and allocate resources for security tools' that 'IBM' will control. Based on 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Дешево создавать приложения для широкой аудитории. Your current fears: Потерять инвестиции в разработку из-за изменения платформы. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Разработчики программного обеспечения'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

Разработчики программного обеспечения declined the resolution proposed by IBM with reasoning: The proposal from IBM, while it promises to enhance software security features and provide a robust framework, does not align with the current desires of 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' to create applications affordably for a wide audience. The reliance on IBM for control over security measures may also increase costs and reduce flexibility, which is a significant concern given the fear of losing investments due to platform changes. Therefore, this proposal fails to benefit our objectives and mitigate our fears.

Производители стандартизированных компонентов suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to implement bio-inspired, neuromorphic computing systems presents an opportunity for 'Производители стандартизированных компонентов' to create components compatible with non-von Neumann architectures, it raises concerns about the control that 'non-von Neumann architectures' would have over the redesign process. This could lead to potential losses if the new standards do not align with the existing market needs or customer expectations.

Разработчики программного обеспечения suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to implement bio-inspired, neuromorphic computing systems offers a transformative approach to software design, it poses a significant risk to my current desire of creating affordable applications for a wide audience due to potential high initial costs and the need for re-training. To align with my goals and mitigate fears of losing investments, I would suggest modifying the proposal to include gradual integration strategies and cost-effective training programs that ensure a smoother transition to support non-von Neumann architectures without jeopardizing existing investments.
We ask 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Разработчики программного обеспечения', you have been approached by 'non-von Neumann architectures' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Производитель компьютеров' with the description: 'Задействовать внешнюю архитектуру комплектующих'.

Разработчики программного обеспечения declined the resolution proposed by non-von Neumann architectures with reasoning: While the proposal to implement non-von Neumann architectures offers potential for innovative software solutions, the associated risks of losing investments in current development platforms create significant fear. The desire to create applications cheaply for a broad audience conflicts with the uncertainty of adapting to new architectures that may require additional resources and training. Therefore, the immediate benefits do not outweigh the risks.

Производители стандартизированных компонентов declined the resolution proposed by Компании-клоны with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Компании-клоны' introduces a level of autonomy and control that may undermine our ability to manage and adapt to new standards effectively. While the prospect of reducing production and delivery time is appealing, the fear of losing control over standard shifts remains a significant concern. The reliance on a collaborative AI-driven ecosystem, controlled by 'Компании-клоны', poses a risk of unexpected changes in standards that could jeopardize our long-term profitability. Therefore, this proposal does not align with our current desires and fails to adequately mitigate our fears.

Разработчики программного обеспечения declined the resolution proposed by Компании-клоны with reasoning: The proposal by 'Компании-клоны' to develop a collaborative AI-driven ecosystem may not align with the current desires of 'Разработчики программного обеспечения', which focus on creating cost-effective applications for a broad audience. While the idea of leveraging genetic algorithms for self-regulation is innovative, the fear of losing investments due to platform changes remains unaddressed. Additionally, the control by 'Компании-клоны' over the project raises concerns about autonomy and potential misalignment with the original interests of 'Разработчики программного обеспечения'. Therefore, the proposal does not sufficiently benefit our desires or mitigate our fears.

Пользователи suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to develop a collaborative AI-driven ecosystem promises to enhance user engagement and create a self-regulating balance between innovation and control, it does not directly address my current desire for affordable access to computers or alleviate my fear of investing in rapidly outdated technology. To make this proposal more appealing, it should include measures to ensure that the technologies developed are cost-effective and remain relevant over time, perhaps by incorporating user feedback into the evolution of standards or providing access to affordable solutions derived from this ecosystem.
