Производители стандартизированных компонентов declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal from 'XG-9' offers an attractive prospect of a 20% reduction in production costs, it introduces significant risks associated with changing standards and control being placed in the hands of 'XG-9'. 'Производители стандартизированных компонентов' has a strong desire for long-term profit and fears losses due to shifts in standards, which this proposal could exacerbate. The potential for instability and the dependency on 'XG-9' for implementation make this proposal less appealing, as it does not sufficiently address the fears of standard changes and potential operational disruptions.

Разработчики программного обеспечения suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution by 'XG-9' presents an innovative approach to standardization that could enhance software performance and efficiency, it raises concerns about control and dependency on a single entity. 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' values affordable application development and is wary of losing investments due to platform changes. A balance needs to be struck that allows for collective innovation without sacrificing autonomy or increasing financial risk. Therefore, I propose to modify the resolution to include a governance structure that ensures diverse stakeholder representation and shared decision-making, thereby maintaining a level of control and independence while fostering innovation.
