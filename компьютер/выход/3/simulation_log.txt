Разработчики программного обеспечения suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Computer technology' offers an intriguing solution for enhancing software performance and security, it raises concerns regarding control and adaptability to local market needs. The integration of a global network of digital twins could potentially lead to a loss of agency over software development processes, which is critical for achieving low-cost solutions for a broad audience. Therefore, I'd suggest modifying the proposal to ensure that local developers maintain a degree of control over the adaptation of standards and practices, allowing for better alignment with regional market dynamics and the preservation of investments.
