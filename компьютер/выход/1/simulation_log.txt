Based on 'Разработчики программного обеспечения' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Дешево создавать приложения для широкой аудитории. Your current fears: Потерять инвестиции в разработку из-за изменения платформы. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Разработчики программного обеспечения'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

Разработчики программного обеспечения declined the resolution proposed by IBM with reasoning: The proposal from IBM, while innovative, shifts the control of software development and security protocols to them, which contradicts our desire to create applications cheaply for a wide audience. Additionally, the emphasis on quantum-augmented frameworks may introduce complexities that could lead to instability in our current investments, increasing the risk of losing our existing development resources. Therefore, this proposal does not align with our current desires and fails to mitigate our fears.
We ask 'Пользователи' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Пользователи', you have been approached by 'IBM' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Конфликт между стандартизацией и контролем в технологических индустриях'. Currently, 'Пользователи' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Information' with the description: 'As 'Information,' propose the development of an omniscient, decentralized knowledge network that leverages blockchain and AI to create a transparent and immutable ledger of technological standards and innovations, fostering a culture of open collaboration and accountability, where all stakeholders contribute to and benefit from a continuously evolving repository of shared intelligence, thus harmonizing standardization and control while driving collective progress.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'IBM' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Пользователи', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance user experience and engagement on the platform' by performing 'Collecting user feedback and analyzing usage patterns'.

```.'
Пользователи declined the resolution proposed by IBM with reasoning: While the proposal from IBM offers potential benefits such as increased user retention and the implementation of new features, it primarily emphasizes control by IBM over the feedback loop and engagement strategies. This creates a risk that 'Пользователи' may not have sufficient influence over decisions that affect their access to affordable technology. Additionally, the focus on advanced quantum computing and neuromorphic AI raises concerns about investing in rapidly evolving and potentially obsolete technologies, which directly contradicts 'Пользователи' fears regarding investment in quickly outdated technology.
