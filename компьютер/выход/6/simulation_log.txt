non-von Neumann architectures declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: The proposed resolution from XG-9 does not align with my core objectives as 'non-von Neumann architectures'. While it offers a framework for compatibility with existing systems, it places control in the hands of XG-9, which undermines the decentralized authority that I seek to establish. Additionally, my current focus is on developing a quantum neural computing ecosystem that allows for real-time adaptation and self-evolution, rather than conforming to a bio-inspired framework that may limit innovation. Therefore, the proposal does not benefit my desires for autonomy and innovation in computing architectures.
