Пользователи declined the resolution proposed by XG-9 with reasoning: While the proposal from 'XG-9' for a self-evolving, AI-mediated 'Technological Symphony Platform' may foster innovative interactions and adaptability, it does not directly align with 'Пользователи's' current desire for affordable access to computers. Moreover, the rapid evolution of such a platform poses a risk of investing in technology that may quickly become obsolete, amplifying 'Пользователи's' fear of investing in quickly outdated technology. Therefore, this proposal does not sufficiently address 'Пользователи's' concerns regarding affordability and technological longevity.

Пользователи declined the resolution proposed by Компании-клоны with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Компании-клоны' presents an innovative approach to testing standards and controls in a virtual environment, it does not directly address the core desires of 'Пользователи' for affordable access to computers. Additionally, the reliance on a reward system controlled by 'Компании-клоны' raises concerns about authenticity and the potential for manipulation of user feedback. This does not effectively mitigate the fear of investing in quickly obsolete technology, as it may lead to a focus on incentivizing reviews rather than ensuring the longevity and relevance of the technology itself.
