Разработчики программного обеспечения suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal by John von Neumann presents an innovative approach to governance through a quantum-based framework, it raises concerns regarding the potential disruption it may cause to current development processes. As 'Разработчики программного обеспечения', our primary desire is to create applications affordably for a wide audience. However, the fear of losing investments due to platform changes is significant.

IBM suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Компании-клоны' introduces an innovative approach to governance through a biologically-inspired system, it raises concerns regarding control and oversight for 'IBM'. 'IBM' values collaboration and transparency, which the original resolution addresses through a collaborative AI-driven governance platform. To align the proposal with 'IBM's interests in maintaining influence over the governance process and ensuring resource allocation for AI-driven projects, I suggest integrating elements of both proposals. This could involve adapting the 'neural network-based governance organism' to operate within the framework of the collaborative governance platform, ensuring that 'IBM' can still contribute and oversee the project effectively.

```.'
IBM declined the resolution proposed by Компании-клоны with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Компании-клоны' offers the potential to develop an AI-driven analytics platform, it places control of the initiative in their hands, which could undermine 'IBM's' ability to steer the direction and evolution of the project. 'IBM' values autonomy in innovation and governance, and the proposed biologically-inspired organism may complicate efforts to maintain transparent and ethical oversight. Additionally, the focus on symbiotic relationships may not align with 'IBM's' current strategic goals of enhancing existing cloud services and solutions, which require a more structured approach. Therefore, this proposal does not align with 'IBM's' interests and could introduce risks that outweigh the potential benefits.

IBM Corporation has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'IBM' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'IBM', you have been approached by 'Производитель компьютеров' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Конфликт между стандартизацией и контролем в технологических индустриях'. Currently, 'IBM' is the initiator of the resolution: 'As IBM, we propose the creation of a collaborative AI-driven governance platform that utilizes blockchain technology to transparently and securely record, analyze, and evolve industry standards and control mechanisms, empowering all stakeholders to contribute to a dynamic, consensus-driven ecosystem that harmonizes technological innovation with ethical oversight and global interoperability.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Производитель компьютеров' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'IBM', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To develop and deliver innovative computing solutions that meet customer needs.' by performing 'Researching and developing new hardware and software technologies.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Производитель компьютеров', I propose the development of an adaptive, bio-cybernetic interface that merges human cognitive processes with machine intelligence to create a unified, evolving consciousness capable of intuitively balancing standardization and control, thus fostering a seamless integration of human values and technological progress in a self-regulating digital ecosystem.', you as 'IBM' will be able to achieve 'Increase market share in the personal computer segment.' by performing 'Implement aggressive marketing strategies and partnerships with retailers.' using 'Establish a collaborative marketing campaign that focuses on product advantages and customer engagement.' that 'Производитель компьютеров' will control. Based on 'IBM' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'IBM'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```.'
IBM declined the resolution proposed by Производитель компьютеров with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Производитель компьютеров' presents an innovative approach to merging human cognition with machine intelligence, it diverges from the current focus of 'IBM' on creating a collaborative AI-driven governance platform. The proposed bio-cybernetic interface does not align with 'IBM's' strategic goals to enhance transparency and accountability in technology standards and control mechanisms. Additionally, control over the marketing strategies may limit 'IBM's' ability to assert its brand identity and leadership in the market. Therefore, this proposal does not benefit 'IBM's' current desires or mitigate any fears.
