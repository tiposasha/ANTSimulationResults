Производитель компьютеров declined the resolution proposed by Производители стандартизированных компонентов with reasoning: The proposed universal modular interface system threatens my desire to dominate the personal computer market by potentially diminishing my control over the standard. While it offers benefits in terms of streamlining production and integrating standardized components, it also means relinquishing control to 'Производители стандартизированных компонентов', which could lead to a loss of market share and competitive advantage. Therefore, this proposal does not align with my current desires and fails to adequately mitigate my fears.

Currently, 'IBM' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Производители стандартизированных компонентов' with the description: 'As 'Производители стандартизированных компонентов,' we propose the creation of a universal modular interface system that allows for seamless interchangeability and interoperability across all technological devices and platforms, enabling innovation and control by standardizing the very framework of technological integration, thus transforming how components are designed, produced, and utilized globally.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Компании-клоны' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'IBM', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance cloud computing services and expand market share.' by performing 'Developing new cloud solutions and engaging with potential clients.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'As 'Компании-клоны,' we propose the creation of a dynamic, self-replicating digital organism that autonomously generates, tests, and implements technological standards through a process of synthetic evolution, leveraging artificial lifeforms to continuously optimize and harmonize innovation and control in a way that mimics natural ecosystems, thereby ensuring our indispensable role in the technological landscape.', you as 'IBM' will be able to achieve 'Increase sustainable technology initiatives within the organization.' by performing 'Implement a company-wide sustainability program focusing on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction.' using 'Establish a task force that reports quarterly on sustainability progress and sets measurable targets for reducing energy consumption.' that 'Компании-клоны' will control. Based on 'IBM' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'IBM'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
IBM declined the resolution proposed by Компании-клоны with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Компании-клоны' involves a significant shift towards a self-replicating digital organism for standardization, which may introduce unpredictability and risk to IBM's operations and control over its technological innovations. Although it offers potential benefits in sustainability initiatives, the loss of control and the reliance on an autonomous system raises concerns about alignment with IBM's strategic goals. Therefore, the proposal does not align well with IBM's current interests and objectives.
