Аннотация: статья содержит результаты анкетирования студентов
Института математики, информатики и естественных наук Московского го-
родского педагогического университета по вопросам их отношения к академи-
ческой честности. Проводится интерпретация и анализ полученных данных. Ав-
тор приходит к выводу, что необходимо проведение и специальной разъясни-
тельной работы, и внедрение особых приемов и методов, способствующих по-
вышению академической честности студентов. Этому должно содействовать
введение обязательной проверки курсовых и выпускных квалификационных ра-
бот системой антиплагиат.
Ключевые слова: академическая честность студентов, личная честность,
плагиат, анкетирование.
Важнейшей проблемой, стоящей сегодня перед системой профессиональ-
ного образования, является проблема повышения качества подготовки специали-
стов. Выпускник вуза должен обладать не только соответствующими знаниями,
умениями и навыками, как это было раньше, но и огромным количеством как
профессиональных, так и общекультурных компетенций. Для повышения каче-
ства образования предлагают различные формы и методы как аудиторной, так и
внеаудиторной самостоятельной работы студентов, разрабатывают различные
пути и способы стимулирования мотивации, познавательной активности и пр. Но
всё это будет малоэффективно без такого явления, как академическая честность
студентов.

Общеизвестно, что академическая честность – это совокупность ценностей
и принципов, которые развивают личную честность в обучении и оценивании.
Часто встречается и такая трактовка, что академическая честность – это достой-
ное поведение при выполнении письменных контрольных работ, экзаменов, эссе,
исследований, презентаций [1].
В последние года интерес к данному явлению, а точнее, к его противопо-
ложности – к академической нечестности, возрастает. Это обусловлено, в
первую очередь, все возрастающим количеством предложений о покупке-про-
даже готовых контрольных, курсовых, дипломных и т. п. письменных работ, до-
ступностью и легкостью подсказок (ведь имея телефон с доступом в интернет
можно без труда найти ответ на практически любой вопрос), а также определен-
ной познавательной леностью обучающихся – ведь гораздо проще взять и/или
купить чужую готовую работу, чем сделать что-то самому.
Несомненно, академическая честность важна для студентов любых вузов и
специальностей: инженеров, химиков, историков, библиотекарей и т. д. Но осо-
бый акцент академическая честность приобретает для студентов педагогических
вузов. Ведь сегодня они – студенты, а завтра – учителя, а некоторые студенты
старших курсов начинают работать учителями, ещё не имея диплома о высшем
образовании, то есть являются и студентами и учителями одновременно.
Работая в педагогическом вузе, поневоле задаешься вопросом – вот эти сту-
денты, которые сейчас хитрят, обманывают, списывают, какими они станут учи-
телями? Смогут ли те, кто списывает сейчас, стать в будущем хорошими педаго-
гами? Иными словами, сможет ли нечестный студент стать честным преподава-
телем?
С целью выявить некоторые тенденции в отношении студентов к их акаде-
мической честности, автором был проведен опрос среди студентов первого, вто-
рого и пятого курсов Института математики, информатики и естественных наук
Московского городского педагогического университета. Всего в анкетировании
приняли участие 178 студентов младших курсов и 25 пятикурсников. Опрос про-
водился анонимно, что позволяет надеяться на правдивые ответы. Большой

разницы между распределением ответов у первокурсников и второкурсников не
было, в связи с этим для них будут представлены суммарные результаты.
Поскольку списывание и плагиат являются наиболее распространёнными
формами академической нечестности, первые вопросы были посвящены именно
этим аспектам.
На первый вопрос: «При написании контрольной работы, теста, я списываю
(подсматриваю в тетрадь, учебник, шпаргалку, использую телефон и т. п.)» по-
давляющее число опрошенных (124 человека) ответили «редко», что составило
70% опрошенных, четвертая часть – 45 студентов (25%) ответили «часто», и
лишь девять студентов (всего 5%) ответили «никогда». Среди пятикурсников от-
веты распределились так: 20 студентов (80%) ответили «редко», три – «часто» и
два – «никогда».
На второй вопрос: «При написании реферата и/или курсовой работы, я
нахожу материал в интернете и использую его, не указывая автора» ответы по-
лучились ещё печальнее: 143 студента (80%) ответили «часто», 32 студента
(18%) ответили «редко», а «никогда» ответили всего три человека, что составило
всего 2% от опрошенных. В качестве оправдания можно сказать, что ни перво-
курсники, ни второкурсники пока курсовых работ не защищали, а готовили
только рефераты. Возможно, когда дело дойдет до курсовых и тем более диплом-
ных работ, ситуация изменится в лучшую сторону. Пятикурсники в полном со-
ставе ответили «редко».
Третий вопрос звучал так: «Я считаю, что педагог должен сурово наказы-
вать тех, кто списывает». Здесь ответы распределились так: «согласны» с данным
высказыванием 45 студентов (25%) младших курсов и 7 студентов (28%) пятого
курса, «не согласны» 133 студента (75%) младших курсов и 18 (72%) пятикурс-
ников. При этом двое студентов дописали, что «наказывать надо, если удается
поймать, а не пойман – не вор».
Четвертый и пятый вопросы были посвящены будущей профессии студен-
тов и связаны с их предполагаемой профессиональной позицией в будущем.

Пятикурсникам при этом предлагалось указать, работают ли они в школе в насто-
ящее время.
На вопрос «Когда я стану учителем, я буду спокойно относиться к тому, что
мои ученики списывают, используют подсказки, шпаргалки, возможно, я даже
разрешу им пользоваться телефоном на контрольных работах и т. п.» были полу-
чены следующие ответы. 93 респондента (46%) ответили категорически – «нет»,
79 студентов (39%) пока не знают, как будут поступать, не задумывались об
этом, и 27 студентов написали – «да», при этом семеро из них уточнили, что
«пользоваться телефоном не разрешат, а подсказки и шпаргалки, написанные от
руки, пусть используют». В настоящее время в школе работают четверо пяти-
курсников и все они ответили, что не разрешают пользоваться ни шпаргалками,
ни телефонами, но не всегда могут уследить за этим.
При ответе на пятый вопрос 39 студентов (19%) согласились с тем, что «сту-
дент, который списывает, ищет ответ в телефоне и т. п., не сможет в будущем
стать хорошим Учителем», 164 (81%) не согласились с этим, при этом один сту-
дент дописал, что «не списывающий студент тоже не обязательно станет хоро-
шим учителем».
Большой интерес представлял шестой, открытый вопрос, где студентам
предлагалось высказать своё собственное мнение об академической честно-
сти/нечестности. К сожалению, большинство этот вопрос проигнорировало, но
среди ответивших встречались весьма интересные мнения. Например, несколько
студентов заявили, что «академической честности не существует», «все люди,
будучи учениками, так или иначе присваивали себе чужие работы и списывали,
только раньше с книг, а сейчас – из интернета», кое-кто даже приписал, что «если
она и существует, то это просто глупо, проще быть нечестным», «даже если зна-
ешь материал, но можно списать, то лучше списывать», «академической честно-
сти нет, да она и не нужна», «без списывания и плагиата в обучении не обой-
тись», «в нашей стране честным быть нельзя» и т. п.
Но были и более развернутые ответы. Например, «на мой взгляд, академи-
ческая честность – это дешевый и бесполезный способ выйти из бедственного

положения образования. Человек должен быть волен использовать и свои зна-
ния, и чужие, тем более при всей широте развития личности обучаемых и отно-
сительности этого самого «плагиата».
«Я считаю, что в первую очередь ты должен быть честен со своей совестью,
ведь тебе становиться специалистом, а не преподавателю. Так что если ты даже
в какой-то день не подготовился, то спиши, но потом обязательно повтори уже
сам материал.»
«Я считаю, что нет ничего страшного в списывании, но только если шпар-
галка сделана своей рукой, а не скопирована на телефон или ответ найден в ин-
тернете.»
Лишь немногие студенты осознают важность и необходимость академиче-
ской честности, приводя, например, такие аргументы: «я считаю, что такой под-
ход очень правильный, ведь он защищает авторские права каждого человека, ко-
торый предоставил миру тот или иной результат своей интеллектуальной дея-
тельности. Каждый должен сам научиться высказывать своё мнение и дойти до
правильной мысли». «Это правильно, но трудно. И вообще честность никому не
навредит.»
А кое-кто из студентов даже предлагали выход из сложившегося положения
с распространением нечестности, указывая, что при устных ответах педагог все-
гда может понять, списывал студент или нет, готовил реферат сам или использо-
вал чужой, а развернутые беседы, когда преподаватель и студент находятся в
непосредственном общении, и возможности списать или использовать подсказки
отсутствуют, представляют собой «наиболее объективный инструмент академи-
ческой честности». Также можно процитировать слова одного из студентов:
«Представьте, что вас лечит врач, который все годы учебы списывал. Хотели бы
вы лечиться у такого врача?» Поэтому проблема академической честности сту-
дентов – весьма важная на сегодняшний день, и будущие учителя, нынешние сту-
денты, должны задуматься о том, имеет ли моральное право педагог, сам будучи
нечестным и нерадивым студентом, учить других, быть для них образцом.

В связи с получившимися результатами можно сделать вывод, что большин-
ство студентов как младших, так и старших курсов, не понимают всей серьезно-
сти использования плагиата, покупки работ, списываний и т. д., поэтому необхо-
димо проведение и специальной разъяснительной работы, и внедрение особых
приемов и методов, способствующих повышению академической честности сту-
дентов. В частности, этому должно содействовать введение обязательной про-
верки курсовых и выпускных квалификационных работ системой антиплагиат.



Академическая честность как этическая проблема
Аннотация. В статье рассматривается понятие академической
честности и модусы актуализации академической честности как эти-
ческой ценности в современном университете. Академическая чест-
ность показана как принцип этики добродетели, а конкретные приме-
ры из университетской жизни дают возможность увидеть ее дейст-
венность в такой системе координат. Ведущая роль данного принци-
па в современной академической сфере показана в контексте актуа-
лизации третьей (после обучения и научного исследования) миссии
университета – общественного служения – и произошедшей в ходе
ее установления массовизации высшего образования.
Ключевые слова: академическая честность, университет, этика
добродетели, добродетель, ценности студента.
В современном академическом дискурсе понятие акаде-
мической честности постепенно занимает центральное место,
отражая общую тенденцию университетской жизни активно
апеллировать к ценностям, призывать членов академического
сообщества следовать им. В украинской академической среде
буквально за последний год был проведен ряд мероприятий, в
центре которых оказывалась академическая честность.
Это Круглые столы и конференции: «Инновационный уни-
верситет и лидерство: перспективы развития» (Одесский госу-
дарственный экологический университет, июль, 2015); Украин-
ско-польская международная научная конференция «Классиче-
ский университет в контексте вызовов эпохи» (Киевский нацио-
нальный университет имени Тараса Шевченко, сентябрь, 2016);
Исследовательские и образовательные проекты: Польско-
украинский проект «Инновационный университет и лидерство»
(2014–2016); «Проект содействия академической добродетели
в Украине (SAIUP)». Социологическое исследование Восточно-
100 Теоретический поиск
украинского фонда социальных исследований совместно с Ин-
ститутом социально-гуманитарных исследований Харьковского
национального университета имени В. Н. Каразина «Академи-
ческая культура студенчества: основные факторы формирова-
ния и развития»; «Осенняя школа исследовательских методов
и академического письма в социально-гуманитарных науках
(платформа «Освітні тренди», сентябрь, 2016). В этот же ряд
можно поставить и создание подкомиссии «Академическая
добродетель» в составе научно-методической комиссии Мини-
стерства образования и науки Украины, а также публикацию и
широкую презентацию в академической среде коллективной
монографии «Академическая честность как основа устойчивого
развития университета» [1].
Собственно, в научный дискурс понятие академической
честности было привнесено американскими учеными, с 1990-х
годов активно обсуждающих проблематику academic integrity.
На постсоветском пространстве в этико-прикладном ключе во-
просы integrity как общей проблемы честности поднимались на
страницах специализированных изданий [5, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Тер-
мин переводился преимущественно как «честность», но сама
его многозначность обуславливала необходимость указания
англоязычного оригинала в скобках рядом с русским перево-
дом. Только Р. Г. Апресян в реферате работы по академиче-
ской этике дает перевод integrity как «добросовестность» [3],
хотя годом ранее этот же термин он переводит как «чест-
ность», применительно к политической сфере [2]. Оксфордский
словарь разъясняет значения слова integrity: качество быть че-
стным и иметь твердые моральные принципы, моральная пря-
мота [22]. Когда Апресян предлагает свой перевод, он указыва-
ет на смыслы, соотносимые с вышеуказанными: «Іntegrity – это,
конечно, целостность, но также и честность, искренность, пря-
мота; в специфическом этико-прикладном аспекте – добросо-
вестность» [3, 228].
Добросовестность – это честность при выполнении обяза-
тельств, обязанностей [16, 150]. В толковом словаре В. Даля
среди значений слова «добросовестность» указываются «бла-
гонамеренность» и «строгая богобоязненность в поступках»
[14, 445]. В целом, речь идет о качествах честности, правдиво-
Рогожа М.М. 101
сти, твердости, возникающих в условиях осознанного следова-
ния взятым и/ или возложенным обязательствам. Необходимо
обратить внимание на второй корень слова «добросовест-
ность» – «совесть». Это традиционное для этической теории
понятие, характеризующее «способность личности осуществ-
лять моральный самоконтроль, самостоятельно формулиро-
вать для себя нравственные обязанности, требовать от себя их
выполнения и производить самооценку совершаемых поступ-
ков» [17, 312]. Речь идет о том, чтобы осознавать и оценивать
собственные действия. Если мы говорим об academic integrity,
то предполагаем обязательность, добросовестность в акаде-
мической среде. Останавливаясь на общепринятом словоупот-
реблении «академическая честность», следует иметь в виду
весь очерченный здесь комплекс смыслов с акцентуацией смы-
слов добросовестности.
Для дальнейшего продвижения в этой теме следует ука-
зать и традицию, сложившуюся в украиноязычной академиче-
ской сфере в отношении перевода термина academic integrity –
«академічна доброчесність» (академическая добродетель).
Здесь можно отчетливо увидеть отсылку академической чест-
ности как добросовестности к этике добродетели. Нет основа-
ний считать такую связку намеренной. Скорее, свою роль сыг-
рали смыслы «добро» и «честность», составляющие украин-
ское слово «добродетель» и в таком своем качестве выходя-
щие на указанные выше значения academic integrity.
На связь академической честности и этики добродетели
специально указывает в своем реферате Р.Г. Апресян: «На ос-
нове этики добродетелей и вырастает концепция добросовест-
ности (integrity), посредством которой на первый план в дея-
тельности учебных заведений вместо «правил и регулятивов»
выдвигаются добродетели, которые рассматриваются как дол-
жная база принятия решений и оценки деятельности» [3, 231].
Добродетели – это такие моральные качества личности,
которые формируются и развиваются в рамках определенной
практики. Исследователи этики добродетели вскрывают дея-
тельностный характер моральных качеств: «Участвуя в практи-
ках, человек развивает в себе как специфические личностные
качества, необходимые для достижения внутренних целей-благ
102 Теоретический поиск
конкретных практик, так и коммуникативные качества, необхо-
димые для взаимодействия с другими участниками практики,
вне которого осуществление практики невозможно» [4, 443]. В
рамках практики формируется система норм и принципов, ко-
торые индивиды осваивают и развивают в процессе деятель-
ности.
В свете этого этические кодексы представляют собой сво-
ды норм и ценностей в духе этики добродетели. В них акаде-
мическая честность выведена основополагающим принципом
деятельности в академической практике.
Рассмотрим принцип академической честности, сформу-
лированный в этическом кодексе Европейского университета-
института во Флоренции (European University Institute, учебное
заведение высшего университетского уровня и исследователь-
ский центр подготовки специалистов гуманитарного профиля
для работы в структурах Европейского союза [15]). Академиче-
ская честность в этом документе [20, 8–9] определена в терми-
нах (добродетелях) правдивости, доверия, честности, уваже-
ния, ответственности, законности. Она выступает в качестве
метапринципа, каждый из параметров которого определяется
соответствующими требованиями. Правдивость основана на
требовании добывать знания, быть включенными в поиск исти-
ны, а также быть интеллектуально честными в изучении, обу-
чении и исследовании. Доверие задается требованием форми-
рования атмосферы взаимного доверия путем поддержки сво-
бодного обмена идеями и возможностью реализации своего
академического потенциала. Честность основывается на тре-
бованиях создания прозрачных институциональных норм и
процедур, а также налаживания взаимодействия между члена-
ми академического сообщества. Уважение как добродетель
связана с требованием (взаимо)уважения студентов, профес-
сорско-преподавательского состава и персонала во имя позна-
ния, образования и интеллектуального наследия. Ответствен-
ность задана требованием поддержания норм поведения в
академической среде. Законность предполагает соблюдение
действующих правовых норм в отношении авторского права,
прав интеллектуальной собственности третьих сторон, средств
и условий, регулирующих доступ к исследовательским ресур-
Рогожа М.М. 103
сам, а также клеветы. Нужно отметить, что в таком свете доб-
родетель законности/ законопослушности задает этическую ус-
тановку: морально быть законопослушным.
Если вести речь об академической честности в контексте
этики добродетели, то закономерно и наличие методических
пособий/ рекомендаций по совершению правильных поступков,
организации правильной деятельности в рамках практики. При-
мером такого методического пособия является «Руководство
для студентов по академической честности в Массачусетском
технологическом институте (Massachusetts Institute of Technolo-
gy)» [19], в котором даны подробные разъяснения целей и за-
дач следования принципам академической честности и прав-
дивости, а также подробно описаны случаи их нарушения. Фор-
мулировки и способ изложения даны предельно четко и понят-
но.
Например, в параграфе «Что такое академическая честн-
ость?» [19, 3] советы даны таким образом, что побуждение к ко-
нкретному действию сопряжено с запретом противоположного.
Так, во-первых, вопрос плагиата ставится следующим об-
разом:
1. «Делай: Верь в ценность собственного ума».
«Не делай: Не приобретай письменные работы и не при-
нуждай кого-либо писать работу для тебя».
2. «Делай: Проводи исследования честно и уважай других
за их работу».
«Не делай: Не копируй идеи, данные и точные формули-
ровки без цитирования источника».
Во-вторых, предлагается вопрос о несанкционированном
сотрудничестве:
«Делай: Думай своим умом».
«Не делай: Не сотрудничай с другим студентом сверх ме-
ры, определенной преподавателем».
В-третьих, уделено внимание вопросам мошенничества.
1. «Делай: Демонстрируй свои собственные достижения».
«Не делай: Не копируй ответы другого студента; не проси
другого студента сделать вместо тебя твою работу. Не подде-
лывай результаты. Не используй электронные или иные при-
способления во время экзаменов».
104 Теоретический поиск
2. «Делай: Принимай исправления преподавателя как
часть учебного процесса».
«Не делай: Не изменяй оценки экзаменов и не подавай их
на пересдачу».
3. «Делай: Готовь оригинальную работу для каждого заня-
тия».
«Не делай: Не подавай проекты или письменные работы,
подготовленные для предыдущего занятия».
В-четвертых, по проблеме содействия академической не-
честности указано:
«Делай: Демонстрируй собственные способности».
«Не делай: Не позволяй другому студенту копировать
твои ответы на проверочных работах или экзаменах. Не сдавай
экзамен или проверочную работу за другого студента».
Далее в «Руководстве» подробно объясняется, что такое
плагиат и указываются конкретные шаги, которые необходимо
предпринять во избежание обвинений в плагиате; разъясняет-
ся, как и какие нужно использовать электронные источники и
как правильно их цитировать. Подчеркивается, что академиче-
ское письмо – неотъемлемая часть академической честности, и
приводятся конкретные примеры корректного избегания пла-
гиата путем переформулировки. Даются разъяснения моделей
сотрудничества студентов в учебном процессе и приводятся
примеры недопустимого взаимодействия. Подается список мо-
шеннических действий в учебном процессе, например, изготов-
ление копий письменных работ, подделка подписей, помощь
другому студенту в аморальных действиях в учебном процессе
и т.п. В результате освоения материала этого методического
пособия студент должен составить внятное представление о
том, что такое академическая честность, как ее достичь и прак-
тиковать, и каковы морально недопустимые действия в этой
сфере.
В недавно опубликованном «Пособии по академической
честности» авторы, признанные специалисты в данной про-
блематике, отмечают, что гораздо эффективнее не давать пе-
речень запретов, описание санкций и примеры наказаний, а по-
казывать и разъяснять конкретные правильные поступки, побу-
ждать индивида к моральному действию [21, 16].
Рогожа М.М. 105
Такого рода подробные инструкции кодексов и методиче-
ских пособий – яркие, но не единичные примеры нравоучи-
тельных текстов в академической сфере. Возникают законо-
мерные вопросы: Почему стало необходимым разъяснять так
подробно, казалось бы, очевидные вещи? Почему академиче-
ская честность стала ценностью, которую вменяют в обязан-
ность так настойчиво и последовательно?
Ответы следует искать в ценностных сдвигах, произо-
шедших в современном университете. Закрепившееся со вре-
мени становления Гумбольдтовского университета единство
обучения и исследования претерпевает сегодня существенные
содержательные изменения, сопряженные с ценностными тра-
нсформациями. Университетская миссия прирастает деятель-
ностью «во благо общества». Стейкхолдеры вместе с профес-
сионалами обсуждает возможности университета быть полез-
ным обществу, реагировать на ожидания общественности. На-
правленность университета на запросы общества изменяет со-
циальные роли преподавателя и студента. Приоритет перехо-
дит от того, кто обучает, к тому, кто получает знания, ориенти-
руясь на рынок труда и дальнейшую трудовую деятельность
после университета [8, 141–142]. Эта тенденция тем более за-
являет о себе, чем сильнее общество нуждается в работниках
со специальными знаниями, навыками, получивших специаль-
ную профессиональную подготовку, которую может обеспечить
нынешний университет.
Неотъемлемой чертой современности становится массо-
вость высшего образования. Эта особенность была озвучена
на Международной конференции по этическим и моральным
изменениям в высшем образовании и наук в Европе (Бухарест,
сентябрь, 2004). В итоговом документе конференции, «Бухаре-
стской декларации по этическим ценностям и принципам выс-
шего образования в европейском регионе» (2004), в преамбуле
было указано: «Университеты отвечают не только за формиро-
вание будущих профессиональных, технических и социальных
элит; они теперь обучают массовые студенческие контингенты»
[9]. Это гораздо раньше предельно четко выразил У. Эко: «В
былое время университеты были элитарными. Туда поступали
дети тех, кто сам кончал университеты… У нас образование но-
106 Теоретический поиск
сит массовый характер. В университеты идет молодежь любых
социальных слоев, после каких угодно школ» [18, 6].
Охват широких слоев населения высшим образованием
меняет критерии отбора абитуриентов: неизбежно снижается
планка требований к уровню их подготовленности к учебе в
университете. Это касается, в первую очередь, моральных ка-
честв, которые необходимы для университетской жизни и кото-
рые, в свою очередь, укрепляются и развиваются в ходе обу-
чения в университете. Например, в отчете Йельского универси-
тета за 1828 г. было указано, что моральное развитие личности
является одной из целей получения высшего образования. Та-
кая постановка вопроса была задана религиозной составляю-
щей в университетской жизни. Преподавательский состав уком-
плектовывался священниками, а студенческий контингент ви-
дел свою миссию после окончания университета в духовной
деятельности [21, 8–9].
Эту же тональность отмечал и Г. С. Батыгин. Он констати-
ровал, что первыми профессионалами в Европе были люди,
чья деятельность связана с миром университета: «Первонача-
льный смысл слова “профессия” заключается в открытом заяв-
лении о принятии монашеского обета… Профессионалы… не
работают, а служат: они отдали себя делу и ничего не просят
взамен» [6, 6]. Это имел в виду и Ж. Бенда, когда писал об ин-
теллектуалах, живущих высшими духовными ценностями, зани-
мающихся бескорыстной умственной деятельностью и видящих
свою миссию в сохранении неутилитарных ценностей [7, 76].
Именно такая установка традиционно принималась и вос-
производилась в университетской среде, как на уровне универ-
ситетских интеллектуалов, так и в процессе обучения – студен-
тами, которые готовились сами стать университетскими интел-
лектуалами, или профессионалами: юристами, медиками, свя-
щенниками, позднее – инженерами. Дух профессионального
служения, ориентированность на высокие этические стандарты
были основой системы ценностных координат в мире универси-
тета.
Ориентированность современного университета на запро-
сы общества, которое нуждается в массах квалифицированных
(специально обученных) работников ведет к массовизации
Рогожа М.М. 107
высшего образования. В таких условиях невозможно сохранить
пафос учебного процесса как морального совершенствования
личности. Поэтому мы не только наблюдаем, но зачастую и ак-
тивно участвуем в институционализации ценностно-норматив-
ной составляющей университетской жизни. Так и получается,
что очевидные ценности – взаимоуважения, доверия, справед-
ливости, научной честности, равно как и способность личности
осознавать свои моральные обязанности по отношению к учеб-
ному процессу, научному знанию и взаимодействию в академи-
ческой среде – перестали быть сами собою разумеющимися, а

FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS, I have researched questions of academic integrity. My initial in- terest in these questions was driven by my own experience as an undergraduate at Princeton University in the mid-1960s. Graduating from a high school where cheating was common, I was particularly intrigued by one item I re- ceived among the blizzard of forms and papers Princeton sent me as I prepared to matricu- late: information about the Princeton honor code. I was informed that exams would be un- proctored; that, on every exam, I would have to affirm that I had not cheated or seen any- one else cheat by signing a pledge (which I can still recite verbatim almost forty years after my graduation); and that all alleged violations of
the code would be ad-
dressed by a student honor committee. Although somewhat skep-
tical in light of my high school experience, I headed off to Princeton confident I would do my part to uphold this seventy-year-old tradi- tion. Apparently, the overwhelming majority of my classmates felt the same way. During my four years at Princeton, I never observed, sus- pected, or heard of anyone cheating, although surely there were at least some minor trans- gressions of the code.
When I returned to academia after more than twenty years in the corporate world, where I witnessed at firsthand the continuous erosion in the ethical values of recent college graduates, I was intrigued by the opportunity to conduct meaningful research on academic integrity. I was particularly curious to see whether campus honor codes were still a vi- able strategy and to explore the impact they were having on a new generation of students. While I remain a strong advocate of honor codes, my thinking about academic integrity has evolved over the last fifteen years—often in surprising ways.
The problem
In the fall of 1990, I surveyed students at thirty-one of the country’s most competitive colleges and universities (McCabe and Trevino 1993). Fourteen institutions had tra- ditional academic honor codes, and seventeen did not, having chosen instead to “control” student dishonesty through such strategies as the careful proctoring of exams. From the more than six thousand students who responded,
I learned several important lessons.
The incidence of cheating was higher than
I expected, and many students were quite willing to admit their transgressions. For ex- ample, 47 percent of students attending a school with no honor code reported one or more serious incidents of test or exam cheat- ing during the past year, as did 24 percent of students at schools with honor codes. While such comparisons would seem to support the power of honor codes, it was not the code it- self that was the most critical factor. Rather, the student culture that existed on campus concerning the question of academic integrity was more important. The existence of a code did not always result in lower levels of cheat- ing. More importantly, the converse was also true: some campuses achieved high levels of integrity without an honor code. While these campuses were doing many of the same things as campuses with codes—e.g., making academic integrity a clear campus priority and placing much of the responsibility for student integrity on the students themselves—they did not use a pledge and they did not mandate unproctored exams. What was important was the culture of academic integrity to which incoming students were exposed.
Many of the students I surveyed were trou- bled by the failure of their institution, and often its faculty, to address the issue of cheating. Because they believed that weak institutional policies and unobservant or unconcerned faculty were “allowing” others to cheat and, thereby, to gain an unfair advantage, students viewed cheating as a way to level the playing field. This was a particular problem on large

& Educational Opportunity
 campuses and in courses with large enroll- ments—environments where, arguably, it is harder to establish a strong, positive commu- nity culture.
In 1993 (McCabe and Trevino 1996), I sur- veyed nine medium to large universities that, thirty years earlier, had participated in the landmark study of college cheating conducted by William Bowers (1964). Bowers’s project surveyed over five thousand students on ninety-nine campuses across the country and provided considerable insight on how often students were cheating and why. Two out- comes of my 1993 project are particularly noteworthy in comparison to Bowers’s results. First, there were substantial increases in self- reported test and exam cheating at these nine
schools. For example, 39 percent of students completing the 1963 survey acknowledged one or more incidents of serious test or exam cheating; by 1993, this had grown to 64 per- cent. Based on student responses to the 1993 survey, however, it was difficult to tell how much of this change represented an actual in- crease in cheating, and how much was simply a reflection of changing student attitudes about cheating. In 1993, many students sim- ply did not see cheating as a big deal, so it was easier to acknowledge—especially in an anonymous survey.
Second, there was no change in the inci- dence of serious cheating on written work; 65 percent of students in 1963 acknowledged such behavior, and 66 percent did so in 1993.

 However, student comments in the 1993 survey suggested that this younger generation of students was more lenient in defining what constitutes plagiarism. Although survey ques- tions were worded to ask students about a spe- cific behavior, without labeling it as cheating, more than a trivial number of students in 1993 said they had not engaged in a particular behavior, while providing an explanation of why the instances in which they actually had done so were not cheating. The ethics of cheating is very situational for many students.
Just as technology has enabled new forms of cheating that are becoming popular with stu- dents, that same technology has made it easier to reach large numbers of students in surveys. Since 2001, I have been conducting Web-based surveys that make it possible to reach an entire campus population with relative ease. However, many students are concerned that it is easier to identify the source of electronically submitted surveys, so they elect either not to participate or to do so while being cautious about what they say. While it is hard to get people to be honest about their dishonesty in any circumstances, it is even harder to get them to do so when they are concerned about the anonymity of their re- sponses. This is reflected in notably lower rates of self-reported cheating in Web surveys and lower levels of participation (as low as 10–15 percent on average compared to 25–35 percent for written surveys in this project).
Nonetheless, in these Web surveys of over forty thousand undergraduates on sixty-eight campuses in the United States and Canada, conducted over the last two academic years, 21 percent of respondents have acknowledged at least one incident of serious test or exam cheat- ing, and 51 percent have acknowledged at least one incident of serious cheating on written work. Although most had engaged in other cheating behaviors as well, four out of every five students who reported they had cheated on a written assignment acknowledged that they had engaged in some form of Internet-related cheating—either cut-and-paste plagiarism from Internet sources or submitting a paper downloaded or purchased from a term-paper mill or Web site. Although the self-reported rates of cheating found in these Web surveys are lower than in earlier surveys, they clearly are still of concern. In addition, the difference may relate more to research methodology than to any real change.
Of concern to whom?
Each campus constituency tends to shift the “blame” for cheating elsewhere. This is a major problem. Many students argue, with some jus- tification, that campus integrity policies are ill-defined, outdated, biased against students, and rarely discussed by faculty. They also fault faculty who look the other way in the face of obvious cheating. They are even more critical of faculty who, taking “the law” into their own hands when they suspect cheating, punish students without affording them their “rights” under the campus integrity policy. Many faculty believe that these campus policies are overly bureaucratic and legalistic and that they often find “guilty” students innocent. Some faculty argue that they are paid to be teachers, not police, and that, if students have not learned the difference between right and wrong by the time they get to college, it’s not their job to teach them—especially in a publish-or-perish world. Although the evidence suggests other- wise, many also believe it’s too late to change student behavior at this point.
Faculty also complain about administrators who fail to support them in the face of what they perceive as obvious cases of cheating. They complain about administrators who, at least in the minds of some faculty, are more concerned with whether the student is a star athlete, the child of a major donor, or has achieved some other favored status. Of course, many adminis- trators can detail a litany of the ways in which they think faculty shirk their responsibilities in the area of academic integrity. Still others com- plain that students are only concerned with grades; how they obtain those grades is less important for many.
The most appropriate response to student cheating depends in large part on the goals of the institution. If the primary goal is simply to reduce cheating, then there are a variety of strategies to consider, including increased proc- toring, encouraging faculty to use multiple ver- sions of exams and not to recycle old tests and exams, aggressively using plagiarism detection software, and employing stronger sanctions to punish offenders. But while such strategies are likely to reduce cheating, I can’t imagine many people would want to learn in such an environ- ment. As educators, we owe our students more than this, especially when cheating may reflect cynicism about what they perceive as eroding moral standards in the academy and in society.

   The ethics
of cheating is very situational for many students
 Today’s students seem to be
less concerned with what ad-
ministrators and/or faculty
consider appropriate behavior
and much more concerned
with the views and behavior of their peers. Students do expect to hear the president, the provost, a dean, or some other official tell them during orientation how they are about to become academic “adults,” adults who re- spect the learning process and who, among other things, don’t cheat. And many students want to hear this message. But it’s clear from student comments in my surveys that the real “proof” for students is in the behavior of their peers and the faculty. Regardless of the campus integrity policy, if students see others cheating, and faculty who fail to see it or choose to ignore it, they are likely to conclude that cheating is necessary to remain competitive. Many students ask, “if faculty members aren’t concerned about cheating, why should I be?”
It takes a village
I have always been intrigued by the African tribal maxim that it takes a village to raise a child. In a similar sense, I would argue it takes the whole campus community—students, fac- ulty, and administrators—to effectively edu- cate a student. If our only goal is to reduce cheating, there are far simpler strategies we can employ, as I have suggested earlier. But if we have the courage to set our sights higher, and strive to achieve the goals of a liberal edu- cation, the challenge is much greater. Among other things, it is a challenge to develop stu- dents who accept responsibility for the ethical consequences of their ideas and actions. Our goal should not simply be to reduce cheating; rather, our goal should be to find innovative and creative ways to use academic integrity as a building block in our efforts to develop more responsible students and, ultimately, more re- sponsible citizens. Our campuses must become places where the entire “village”—the commu- nity of students, faculty, and administrators— actively works together to achieve this goal. As Ernest Boyer observed almost two decades ago (Boyer 1987, 184), “integrity cannot be divided. If high standards of conduct are ex- pected of students, colleges must have impec- cable integrity themselves. Otherwise the lessons of the ‘hidden curriculum’ will shape the undergraduate experience. Colleges teach
values to students by the stan- dards they set for themselves.” In setting standards, faculty
have a particularly important
role to play; students look to them for guidance in academic matters—not
just to their peers. In particular, to help stu- dents appropriately orient themselves and de- velop an appropriate mental framework as they try to make sense of their college experi- ence, faculty must recognize and affirm acade- mic integrity as a core institutional value. Without such guidance, cheating makes sense for many students as they fall back on strategies they used in high school to negotiate heavy work loads and to achieve good grades.
One of the most important ways faculty can help is by clarifying their expectations for ap- propriate behavior in their courses. Although faculty certainly have the primary responsibil- ity here, they should share this responsibility with students. Not only does such “consulta- tion” result in policies in which students feel a greater degree of ownership and responsibility, but it also helps to convince students they truly are partners in their own education. Nonethe- less, faculty do have a unique and primary role to play in the classroom, and it is incumbent upon them not only to minimize opportunities to engage in academic dishonesty (even if only out of fairness to honest students) but also to respond in some way when cheating is sus- pected. While some may argue over the most appropriate response, it is essential that there be some response. As noted earlier, students suggest that faculty who do nothing about what appears to be obvious cheating simply invite more of the same from an ever-increasing number of students who feel they are being “cheated” by such faculty reluctance.
While faculty can do much to improve the climate of academic integrity in their campus “villages,” they should not be expected to shoulder this burden alone. University admin- istrators need to look more carefully at the role they play. The Center for Academic In- tegrity at Duke has encouraged, and helped, many campuses to examine their academic integrity policies, yet there are still many schools that have not reviewed their policies in decades. Instead of reacting to an increas- ing number of faculty complaints about Inter- net plagiarism by simply subscribing to a plagiarism detection service, for example,
 SUMMER/FALL 2005 LIBERAL EDUCATION 29

 perhaps these schools should take a more comprehensive look at their integrity policies. While some may decide that plagiarism detec- tion software is an appropriate component of their integrity policy, I trust many more will conclude that it’s time to abandon their almost exclusive reliance on deterrence and punish- ment and to look at the issue of academic dis- honesty as an educational opportunity as well.
Over the last fifteen years, I have become convinced that a primary reliance on deter- rence is unreasonable and that, if we truly be- lieve in our role as educators, we would do better to view most instances of cheating as educational opportunities. While strong sanc- tions clearly are appropriate for more serious forms of cheating, it’s also clear that most stu- dent cheating is far less egregious. What, for example, is an appropriate sanction for a stu- dent who cuts and pastes a few sentences from a Web site on the Internet without citation? In some cases, this behavior occurs out of ig- norance of the rules of citation or is motivated by a student’s failure to properly budget his or her time. In a last minute effort to complete the two papers s/he has due that week, as well as study for a test on Friday, s/he panics. If the student is a first-time “offender,” what’s the educational value of a strong sanction?
Having decided that sanctions do little more than to permanently mar a student’s record, an increasing number of schools are taking a more educational approach to acade- mic dishonesty. They are striving to imple- ment strategies that will help offending students understand the ethical consequences of their behavior. These strategies seem often to be win-win situations. Faculty are more willing to report suspected cheating, or to ad- dress it themselves, when they understand that educational rather than punitive sanc- tions are likely to result. A common choice now is to do nothing or to punish the student privately, which makes it almost impossible to identify repeat offenders. On a growing num- ber of campuses, however, faculty are being en- couraged to address issues of cheating directly with students. As long as the student acknowl- edges the cheating and accepts the faculty member’s proposed remedy, the faculty member simply sends a notation to a designated party and never gets involved with what many con- sider the unnecessary bureaucracy and legalisms of campus judicial systems.
When more faculty take such actions, stu- dents who cheat sense they are more likely to be caught, and the overall level of cheating on campus is likely to decline. Administrators, especially student and judicial affairs person- nel, can then devote more of their time and resources to proactive strategies. For example, several schools have developed mini-courses that are commonly part of the sanction given to first-time violators of campus integrity poli- cies; others have devoted resources to promot- ing integrity on campus, rather than investing further in detection and punishment strategies. A common outcome on campuses implement- ing such strategies is a greater willingness on the part of faculty to report suspected cheat- ing. They view sanctions as more reasonable, designed to change behavior in positive ways, demonstrating to students that inappropriate behavior does have ethical consequences. As students quickly learn that second offenses will be dealt with much more strongly, in- creased reporting also serves as an effective deterrent to continued cheating.
Of course, the most effective solution to student cheating is likely to vary from campus to campus, depending on the unique campus culture that has developed over the course of a school’s history. Indeed, no campus is likely to reach the ideal state where the proactive strategies I have described are sufficient in and of themselves. Rather, some balance of punishment and proactive strategies will be optimal on each campus and, although that optimum will vary from campus to campus, punishment will always have some role. The stakes are high for most college students to- day, who think their entire future—their chances of gaining admission to professional school, getting job interviews with the best companies recruiting on campus, etc.—de- pends on a few key grades. It is, therefore, un- realistic to think that none will succumb to the temptation to cheat.
Students, even the most ethical, want to know that offenders will be punished so that other students will be deterred from engaging in similar behaviors. In fact, I am often sur- prised by the comments many students offer in my surveys calling for stronger punishments for students who engage in serious cheating. While they are willing to look the other way when someone engages in more trivial forms of cheating to manage a heavy workload, for

example, they are far less forgiving of students who cheat in more explicit ways on major tests or assignments. The difficult task for every school is to find the appropriate balance be- tween punishment and proactive strategies that deters students who would otherwise cheat when the opportunity arises yet that also works to build a community of trust among students and between students and faculty, a campus community that values ethical behavior and where academic integrity is the norm.
The need to achieve some balance between punishment and proactive strategies was well summarized for me this spring when I made a presentation at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. A second class- man who was listening to my emphasis on proactive strategies suggested that, since stu- dents see so much cheating in high school and in the larger society, deterrence probably plays an important role in reducing cheating in col- lege. In his own case, he suggested that during his first two years at the academy the biggest factor in his decision not to cheat was fear of the strong sanctions that existed and were of- ten used. But during those two years, he was also exposed to many proactive messages about why integrity matters, especially in an occupation where the lives of so many may depend on doing one’s job with integrity. He observed that he has now reached the point where he wouldn’t think of cheating—no longer for fear of punishment, but because he understands the importance of integrity. How- ever, for him, and perhaps for many other stu- dents, those strong rules helped him learn behaviors that he could later understand and value for more idealistic reasons. No campus may ever reach a truly ideal combination, but deterrence and proactive strategies both should play an important role in any academic integrity policy.
Do something
It is impossible to know whether such propos- als will work on every campus. But to those campuses that have doubts about the effec- tiveness of such strategies, I offer the same ad- vice I give students when they express concern about reporting peers they suspect of cheating because of the fear of reprisal or be- cause they believe sanctions on their campus are too severe. Do something! While I’m sure there are some campuses where the modest
suggestions offered here may not work as well as other possible choices, I’m even more con- vinced that any campus that has not reviewed its integrity policies for some time is derelict in its responsibilities to its students and likely has a degree of discontent among its faculty. Perhaps even more important, it is depriving its students of an important learning opportunity in the true liberal arts tradition.



ABSTRACT
This paper presents results of a study that
investigated the role of perceptions of normative behavior concerning
academic cheating on self-reported cheating behaviors. A survey was
distributed to 250 undergraduates (87 responses) in which demographic
information was obtained and the students (nearly all aged 18-22
years) were asked about their knowledge of other people's
participation in 15 specific behaviors; to report how often he or she
personally participated in the same 15 behaviors; and to rate how
dishonest each of the 15 behaviors was, on a bipolar scale. Among the
findings were the following: (1) cheating is widespread on college
campuses; (2) the participating students reported high incidence of
cheating for others (99%) as well as for themselves (81%); (3) the
student's own cheating was viewed as not at all unusual--it was seen
as a reflection of situational forces; and (4) the students also
believed that others benefited more from cheating than they
themselves did. Finally, the students also blamed their parents and
teachers for widespread cheating because of pressure being placed on
them to do well. The study showed that if cheating is widespread, it
is in part due to its acceptance among college undergraduates.

Academic cheating appears to be epidemic on college campuses. The Chronicle of
Ilizher Education recently reported that 37% of surveyed college freshmen said they had
cheated on a test in high school, and 57% admitted to copying another student's work
(American Council on Education, cited in Collison, 1990a). Another recent study reported
that one third of college students cheated in at least eight of their courses in college, while
nearly half admitted to cheating in one or two courses (Moffatt, cited in Collison, 1990b).
Earlier research seems to indicate that between 40% and 90% of all college students in the
LS. have cheated at some point during their college education (Jendrek, 1989). Our
laboratory research demonstrated that in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes (e.g., a poor
grade or personal information being disclosed to an authority figure) most students opted
to use deceptive tactics over honest ones (Greene & Saxe, 1991). Cheating is so
widespread and so acceptable that there is now a book written by a journalism major at
Rutgers University available to undergraduates entitled CholingiQL_I Bag_ eAe_an
Fundamentals of Earning the Easy "A" ((lower, 1992).
Thus, it appears from both surveys and other forms of research that dishonesty is a
ubiquitous feature of undergraduate college life. It is also the cast that not only do
students cheat in school, but despite our parents' attempts to indoctrinate us against telling
lies, deception has become an acceptable way for people to interact with each other in
many aspects of life. We lie to our parents when they ask us why we were out so late, to
our teachers when we tell them the dog ate our homework, and to our dates when we
compliment them on their new outfits we do not like. We cheat on exams, steal office
supplies from work, and use deceptive tactics to convince customers to buy useless items.
There is certainly no shortage of examples of dishonesty in everyday life. The questions
that need to be asked, however, are not what kind of lies do people tell and to whom, but
considering that we are taught and we teach others that lying is wrong, why do people
choose to lie? What circumstances are conducive to deceptive behavior? What are the
Academic Dishonesty
3
motivating factors behind individual's decisions to be dishonest? This study attempted to
collect data that describe some of the variables that contribute to dishonesty and to explain
how people are able to justify this behavior despite our assumption that they believe it is
wrong to be dishonest.
In psychology, a growing literature has evolved on the issue of deception (see,
e.g., De Paulo & Rosenthal, 1979; Bond, Kahler, & Paolicelli, 1985; De Paulo, Stone, &
Lassiter, 1985). Many of these researchers have focused their efforts on finding the clues
targets (tIr se who are lied to) use to detect when senders (those who are lying) are being
dishonest, and what behaviors senders display when they lie (see, e.g., Ekman & Friesen,
1974; De Paulo, Lanier, & Davis, 1983; Stiff, Miller, Sleight, Mongeau, Garlick, &
Rogan, 1989). The typical paradigm used in such research involves subjects watching
videotapes of people lying about some things and telling the truth about others. They are
then are asked to make judgments about who ij being truthful and who is not.
Ekman and Friesen (1974) found that senders could successfully disguise their faces
when they were lying to appear as if they were telling the truth. Bond et al. (1985), found
that targets tend to focus on facial behavior. Thus, senders who maintain eye c ,tact and
serious looks on their faces are often successful liars. Stiff et al. (1989) found that the
less familiar the situation, the more targets depend on nonverbal cues to make judgments
of veracity, while those targets in familiar situations were almost uninfluenced by
nonverbal cues.
Other techniques people use to deceive successfully are: hamming or exaggerating
(De Paulo and Rosenthal, 1979); maintaining a positive demeanor; displaying "normal"
conversation behaviors such as smiling, nodding in agreement, and not interrupting (Buller
& Aune, 1987); playing up to the known attitudes and preferences of their targets
(De Paulo, Stone, & Lassiter, 1985); and effectively taking the perspective of the target
(Hyman, 1989). The necessity for this last strategy suggests a reason that young children
Academic Dishonesty
4
may be unsuccessful deceivers as they can not fully appreciate how the situation appears to
their target (Hyman, 1989).
In addition, research has been conducted on techniques for combating theft and
deception in both the workplace and in college classrooms (see, e.g., Mueller, 1953;
Heisler, 1974; Hollinger & Clark, 1983; Baumer & Rosenbaum, 1984). Much of this
researrh has focused on attempting to catch people in lies in order to deter others from
being deceptive. Before we can attempt to prevent people from acting dishonestly,
however, it is important to understand why it is that they choose this sort of behavior. If
we understand the environmental factors that motivate deception, we can then try to create
situations that are conducive to honesty which might make methods for deception detection
unnecessary.
A number of scholars have attempted to explain why people behave deceptively.
Ford, King, and Hollender (1988) have proposed a number of possible reasons that people
lie. hey suggest that one developmental explanation for lying is that it may be the way
children attempt to differentiate themselves from their parents and establish an individual
identity. If this is the case, lying probably begins when children learn that their parents
cannot control their thoughts.
According to Ford et al. (1988), power is another reason for deception. Having
information, maintaining its secrecy, and leaking misinformation can be extremely
powerful tools in all sorts of relationships from business dealings to international rela,
Bok (1978) notes, however, that once a person is suspected of lying, he/she may lose that
power.
Lying also serves the purpose of self-deception (Foal et al., 1988). It can facilitate
repression and denial, and can help regulate self-esteem. In fact, it is possible that by
telling a lie enough times, the liar may begin to truly believe its veracity.
One study (Miller & Tesser, 1988), suggests that lying is a response to a violation
1
Academic Dishonesty
5
of the expectations of the target. Students were asked about their attitudes towards
particular behaviors, and the attitudes they believed their parents and employers had
towards those same behaviors. They then asked students how likely they would be to lie
to their parents or employers had they engaged in these behaviors. Miller & Tesser found
that the occurrence of deception depended on the target's expectations, not the senders. In
other words, lying was produced when the subjects felt that their targets would disapprove
of their behavior, regardless of whether or not the subjects believed the behavior was
wrong. The motivation to lie was to save face with the target.
In their discussion of white-collar crime, Hirschi and Gottfredson (1987) define
crime as a "force or fraud...used to satisfy self-interest, where self-interest refers to the
enhancement of pleasure and the avoidance of pain". Thus, they claim that people are
dishonest in the workplace because it is a fast and certain way to attain goals with minimal
effort. This may also be a reason students cheat in college courses. If they believe, for
example, that using crib sheets on an exam is easier than studying and that they will
receive high grades with the crib sheets, they may be likely to do so.
A possible reason for employee theft according to Sieh (1987) is that it is a
response to perceived inequity. Unfairness has also been shown to result in dishonesty in
academic settings. In a survey at a midwestern college, unfairness was suggested by a
student as a factor that encouraged cheating (Mueller, 1953). Other situational factors
students claimed encouraged cheating included: exam solely or largely determined grade
(high stakes); instructor had superior attitude; lack of good rapport between professor and
students (adversarial and impersonal environment); poor teaching; and objective tests (one
word answers or multiple choice). One student surveyed was quoted as saying that
"everybody cheats on this campus; nobody seems to care, and nobody seems to expect
honesty" (Mueller, 1953).
Some psychological research suggests that there might be a curvilinear relationship
Academic Dishonesty
6
between cheating and anticipated success (Houston, 1978). Subjects who are certain that
they will fail, regardless of what they might do to improve their grades, do not cheat
because they do not believe it is a viable means for attaining success. Those who are sure
they will succeed do not cheat because they do not need to, Subjects who anticipate
possible but not sure success are most likely to cheat because they feel it can help them out
of their unsure situation. They might not cheat, however, when the risk of being detected
is high (Houston, 1977).
Competition also amears to motivate academic cheating, especially when the
student is doing poorly (Cocper & Peterson, 1980). For certain people (those who score
high in Machiavellianism), competition with another person is likely to produce
dishonesty, while for others (low Machs), personal competition produces more cheating.
These theories, although somewhat helpful, do not adequately explain the
prevalence of dishonesty and the ease with which people seem to lie and cheat. Perhaps
people ignore the advice given to them by parents and teachers and instead gauge their
behavior by we actions of others. If individuals believe that everyone (or at least most
others) lie, they may be more likely to lie themselves and might more easily find ways to
justify their behavior.
The goal of the present study was to investigate the role of perceptions of
normative behavior concerning academic cheating on self-reported cheating behaviors. If
subjects think cheating is normative, that "everyone does it", they should be more likely to
report participation in deceptive behavior, to think that cheating is less dishonest, and to
find ways to justify their actions. The hypotheses, thus, were that high levels of self-
reported cheating would be associated with reports of high levels of cheating on the pait of
others, and that those specific behaviors subjects admitted to, would be classified as less
dishonest and more justifiable than those behaviors they claimed they did not take part in.
Thus, subjects would admit to participating in those behaviors that are crinsidered
7
Academic Dishonesty
7
normative and would not deem them dishonest or unjustified. It was also predicted that
subjects would report significantly more cheating on the part of their classmates than for
themselves. In addition, we predicted that subjects would claim that others benefitted
more from cheating than they themselves did. They would believe that they could do
equally well without cheating, but that others needed to cheat in order to get meritorious
grades.
In order to demonstrate this phenomenon, we distributed a survey called the
"Academic Practices Questionnaire" to undergraduates at a small, private university that
asked students to report the occurrence frequency of a number of cheating behaviors. The
pasticular behaviors were selected on the basis of the outcome of a four person focus
group. The purpose of a focus group is to "bring together several participants to discuss a
topic of mutual interest 1.co themselves and the researcher" (Morgan & Spanish, 1984). The
group consisted of four undergraduates (two seniors and two juniors) who discussed the
amount and types of cheating that occur on campus. Using these discussions, fifteen
behaviors were chosen for the survey.
Method
Subjects: Subjects were 250 undergraduatcs who left their mailboxes open for the
summer session (they were either enrolled in summer courses, or were living locally). Of
the surveys distributed, 87 (35%) were returned. Eighty-two of the returned
questionnaires were completed properly and were used in the analyses.
Procedure: The questionnaires were distributed by placing them in the mailboxes
of all students who requested that their boxes remain open for the summer. Subjects were
told in a cover letter that the questionnaire asked about the methods college students use to
..hicve high grades in college. They were assured that their answers would remain
confidential. In order to protect subjects' anonymity, there was no identifying information
on the questionnaire. Subjects were told that the questionnaires would be destroyed one

year following the completion of the data analysis. They were provided with an envelope
and asked to return the survey to the experimenter via campus mail. They were asked to
return the questionnaire even if they elected not to fill it out.
The questionnaire consisted of both Likert scale items, as well as open-ended
questions. The first section of the questionnaire asked about demographic information.
The second section consisted of bipolar scaled questions asking about the subject's
knowledge of other people's participation in 15 behaviors (see Table 1).
Insert Table 1 about here.
The next section asked subjects to report how often he or she personally
participated in the same 15 behaviors. The forth section asked the subjects to rate how
dishonest each of the 15 behaviors was, also on a bipolar scale. The last section asked
open-ended questions about the worst form of cheating the subject participated in and
someone the subject knows participated in, as well as questions about whether or not these
cheating behaviors resulted in better grades, and an open-ended question asking subjects
why they think people cheat in college.
Results
Subjects: Ninety-eight percent of the subjects were between the ages of 18 and 22,
and 99% will graduate between the years 1992 and 1994. The largest group is 20 years
old (42%) and will graduate in 1992 (54%). There were many more female respondents
(74% versus 26% male), but subjects were evenly distributed across major and normally
across grade point average. When asked about their post-graduation plans, 51% of
subjects said they planned on attending graduate school to earn either an MA or PhD.
Fifteen percent plan to attend law school, 10% medical school, and 1% business school,
making a total of 77% who plan to attend some kind of graduate school to earn an
9

9
advanced degree. Twelve percent will look for jobs, and 11% said they did not know
what they will do after they graduate.
A repeated measures ANOVA was run on the data from the scaled questions using
"who" (2 levels, you versus other) and each question (15) as the within subjects factors.
A main effect for who, F(1,79)=133.47, p< .001 was found indicating that subjects
reported more cheating on the part of people they knew than for themselves (see Figure 1).
T-tests were then performed on each of the you-other pairs. [Because of the large
number of t-tests conducted, a stict p value (.001) was used to determine significance.]
For example, the report of how frequently the subject heard about other people
participating in copying answers during an exam was compared to how frequently the
subject reported that he or she copied answers during an exam. Each of these comparisons
resulted in significant differences (p< .001). Thus, for every individual behavior listed on
the questionnaire, subjects reported significantly more cheating done by others than
themselves (see Table 2).
Insert Table 2 about here.
The frequency with which subjects participated in each of the behaviors was noted
and they were ranked from most common to least common. Differences in the frequency
of these behaviors was examined. The most popular cheating behavior, working on
individual assignments in groups (M = 3.42), was significantly more popular than all
other forms of cheating (p< .005 for group vs. notes, p< .001 for group vs. all other
cheating behaviors). Then next three types cheating in the rank ordering, using someone
else's notes (M = 2.83), using someone else's old exams (M = 2.51), and making up a
story to tell a professor to get more time to complete an assignment (M = 2.35) were
done at similar rates, but were reported significantly more frequently than the other types
Academic Dishonesty
10
of cheating (2< .G01 for all differences) (see Table 3).
Insert Table 3 about here.
Comparisons were also made between the levels of dishonesty of each of the 15
behaviors. Subjects evaluated those behaviors they participated in more often as less
dishonest than those they did not. For example, working on individual assignments with
other members of the class, the most popular type of cheating, was rated as significantly
less dishonest than all other behaviors (12 < .001) except for using someone's old exams
which was seen as equally dishonest, and using someone else's notes which was rated
significantly less dishonest than working in groups (1=-7.11, g< .001). The second most
popular cheating behavior, using someone else's notes, was rated as significantly less
dishonest than all other behaviors (g< .001) (see Table 4).
Insert Table 4 about here.
Subjects were asked, in an open-ended question, to report one incident of cheating
that they had participated in, and one that someone they know took part in. Eighty-one
percent of subjects were able to think of an incident they were involved in, but 99% of
subjects were able to come up with a story about someone else's cheating. A t-test done
on the square root tiansformation of their responses indicates that these percentages are
significantly different, t=3.78, g< .001, showing that subjer,ts were able to recall an
incident of someone else's cheating more easily than they could cite an event when they
cheated personally (see Table 5).

Subjects were also asked if they thought that these cheating episodes resulted in
better grades for either themselves or for the other person. Oi-ic half of the subjects
believed that they received a better grade in the course because they cheated, while 71%
believed that their peers who cheated did better in the class than they would have if they
had not cheated. The t-test showed these results to be significantly different, t=2.78,
< .008. Thus, subjects believed that other people's cheating was more beneficial to their
grades than their cheating was to their own grades (see Table 6).
Insert Table 6 about here.
A MANOVA was conducted on the data to determine if those subjects who
reported a cheating event in the open-ended question also reported more cheating on the 15
scaled questions. A main effect was found, F(1,70)=7.00, j< .01, showing that those
who told of a cheating incident also reported significantly more cheating on the other
behaviors.
Discussion
The results of the present investigation support other research which indicated that
cheating is rife on college campuses. Subjects reported high incidence of cheating for both
others (99%) as well as for themselves (81%). As predicted, they did report more
cheating on the part of their classmates than for themselves. In addition, they seem to
believe that the behaviors in which they participate are less dishonest than those they do
not. Although the previously discussed motivators for cheating have been observed in the
laboratory, they do not fully explain why subjects reported cheating or why cheating
Academic Dishonesty

appears to be so common. In order to participate in an activity we assume they would
ordinarily label as 'as was shown by their high dishonesty ratings of many of the
cheating behaviot .1,ents must find a way to ratkmalize their actions such that they
convince themselves that what they are doing is acceptabliz. One such way is by
comparing themselves to their peers and persuading themselves that their behavior is less
bad than that of other people they know. This posaibility, illustrated by social comparisun
theory (Su ls & Wills, 1989), and specifically the theories of downward comparison and
uniqueness bias, was supported by the data as subjects reported higher frequencies of
cheating on the part of their classmates than they did for themselves.
The theory of downward comparison states that people will compare themselves to
others who are worse off than they are in order to appear better themselves (Wills, 1991).
Lateral comparison may also be useo when rationalizing distasteful attributes, as it is seen
as a way to reduce feelings of deviance. Thus, when people compare themselves to those
who are just as bad or worse off than they are, they feel better about themselves.
The uniqueness bias is the inclination for people to underestimate the number of
people who will act in socially desirable ways (Goeetals, Messick, & Allison, 1991). This
results in the tendency for people to believe that they themselves are uniquely good, or at
least no worse than anyone else. People are able to convince themselves that they are
better than average (Myers & Ridl, 1979) in a number of domains including goodness
(Allison, Messick, & Goethals, 1989).
These theories of social comparison help explain how students who believe that
cheating is wrong, are nevertheless able to engage in cheating behaviors. If they believe
that everyone else cheats more than they do, they are able to excuse their own oc( r!onal
misbehavior. When ked to discuss their own cheating behavior, r., -lents are able to
come up with a peer group with whom to compare themselves via constructive social
comparison. This is defined as "social comparison 'in the head,' with little regard for
Academic Dishonesty
13
actual social reality, and is comprised of a number of processes, including the
manufacturing of self-serving consensus estimates" (Goethals, Messick, & Allison, 1991).
Because people tend to believe that they are uniquely good, subjects were able to convince
themselves that they are better than average (Myers & Ridl, 1979). By choosing to
compare themselves to "cheaters", subjects convinced themselves that they were better
than their xers. Students are able to view their cheating behavior as not at all unusual,
and they see it as a reflection of situational forces acting upon them.
Subjects' answers on open-ended questions about why people cheat confirmed this
possible explanation. One student said that cheating occurs because it is the "accepted
norm today" and that "students rationalize [by telling themselves that] everyone else is
[doing it]". Another subject said that "if cheating was the way in high school, why should
they uop now?". It is clear that these subjects felt that cheating is normative. Because
everyone else does it, their own dishonest behavior is justified. Perhaps students feel that
if they do not cheat, they put themselves at a disadvantage because they believe that
everyone else is taking whatever measures necessary to achieve high grades.
Subjects also believed that others benefitted more from cheating than they
niemselves did. Because social comparison helps to mike them think they are "better"
than others, they are able to attribute their good grades to their own honest efforts, not
their cheating, while they believe others are dependent on cheating for high grades. T ey
believe they would have received the same grade without cheating which allows subjects to
justify their dishonest behavior. They convinced themselves that, although they
participated in a dishonest activity, the consequences were no different than if they had
acted in a completely honest way, Thus, they see their cheating behaviors merely as
"insurance" against a possible hazard.
Contributing to cheating justification is the fact that those behaviors subjects
participated in most were classified as less dishonest than those they abstain from. Thus,
Academic Dishonesty
14
they excuse themselves from this dishonest behavior by deciding that it is not dishonest,
and in some circumstances, these behaviors are seen as perfectly warranted.
For example, many students felt that "having and unfair abivaniage [such as having
access to an exam others do not have] was dishcnest", but "provided all work you turn in
is your own and it fulfills the assignment'', forms of cheating like crib notes, bringing
completed 'Ilue books to exams, or turning in a paper to more than one class was alright.
As long as you did the work to make the crib sheet or answet the essay questions in the
blue book, these behaviors were excused. Copying another students work, however, was
unacceptable to most subjects because it involved "stealing" another student's work or
ideas.
Students also blame their parents and teachers for widespread cheating. "Pressure"
to do well and get into graduate and professional school was often used as an excuse. One
student said that students cheat in college because "the Reagan-Bush 'achievement ethic'
throws honesty and integrity out the window in favor of personal gain".
Some r bjects exhibited outright hostility toward their professors when asked about
why people cheat. One sthject said that "professors have the tendency to believe that their
class is the only one you have and obviously there is a lot more to college than this".
Another student justified using old exams to study from by saying that "if a teacher is lazy
enough to keep his/her class exactly the same f om year to year, then she/he deserves to
have students [cheat)". Yet another student believes that people cheat because of both the
"pressure to get good grades" as well as the "challenge to fool professors".
It appears as if cheating is widespread, in part, because it is an acceptable practice
among college undergraduates. Almost all report participating in deceptive academic
practiiles at some point in their college careers, and virtually all of them know at least one
classmate who has cheated in at least one course. In order to curb the drastic number of
cheating incidents, we must find a way to make cheating unacceptable on the part of those
Academic Dishonesty
15
who participate in such behavior. As long as cheating is the norm and undergtaduates
believe that it is justified, we cannot hope to foster environments of academic integrity.
Although this study helps to further our understanding of cheating on college
campuses, there were a few problems with the research the most worrisome of which was
the low response rate. Only about 35% of the students contacted returned completed
surveys. Perhaps there is something different about those who chose to respond to the
survey. However, our technique for distributing the questionnaires might be at fault. It is
possible that, despite the tact that they left their mailboxes open during the summer, some
of the students may not have been checking their mail at regular intervals, and thus may
not have received the survey in time to cr mplete and return it to the experimenters.
Because the data are consistent with past findings, it is hoped that the present findings are
reliable in spite of the low response rate.
Another problem with the research is with the explanation of the results. There is
a chicken and egg sort of difficulty that is not interpretable vith the present data. This
obstacle is with our inability to separate the justification from the cause. In other words,
the experimenters cannot know if students cheat because they believe everyone else does,
or if they say that others cheat in order to justify their own cheating behavior. Further
investigation will have to be done to examine these possibilities.

*is study provided a content analysis of studies aiming to disclose how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to the education sector and explore the potential research trends and challenges of AI in education. A total of 100 papers including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytic papers were selected from the education and educational research category of Social Sciences Citation Index database from 2010 to 2020. *e content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of *ings, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for further investigation. However, we also proposed the challenges in education may be caused by AI with regard to inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical issues. *e results provide insights into an overview of the AI used for education domain, which helps to strengthen the theoretical foundation of AI in education and provides a promising channel for educators and AI engineers to carry out further collaborative research.
1. Introduction
*e emergence of big data, cloud computing, artificial neural networks, and machine learning has enabled en- gineers to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence. Building on these technologies, this study refers to machines that are able to perceive, recognize, learn, react, and solve problems as artificial intelligence (AI) [1, 2]. Inevitably, such smart technologies will rev- olutionize the workplaces of the future [3]. *us, while AI can interact and help humans perform at higher levels, it is emerging as the next disruptive innovation [4]. AI is currently viewed by many as a driver that is integral to the
fourth industrial revolution, and it may trigger the fourth revolution in education. Learning about AI has also begun to be part of school curriculum [5, 6]. However, just as the emergence of television and computers was once touted to be game changers of education, they have been shown to in fact enhance access to information without substan- tially changing the core educational practices. Nonethe- less, educators are obliged to review current AI capabilities and identify possible pathways to optimize learning. Given the increasing attention, it is timely to review recent AI research in education to provide edu- cators with an updated understanding of the field as a preparation to possible changes.
2
Complexity
AI has been increasingly propagated as having strategic value for education [7]. Loeckx [8] suggested that AI could be an effective learning tool that lessens the burdens of both teachers and students and offers effective learning experi- ences for students. Coupled with current education reforms such as the digitalization of educational resources, gamifi- cation, and personalized learning experiences, there are many opportunities for the development of AI applications in education. For example, the modelling potential of AI techniques has been exploited systematically to develop reactive and adaptive tutorials for the construction of in- dividualized learning environments as compensation for the shortage of teachers through the use of intelligent tutoring system (ITS) [10]. ITSs provide personalized learning ex- perience in four main ways: monitoring student’s input, delivering appropriate tasks, providing effective feedback, and applying interfaces for human-computer communica- tion [7]. When more ITSs are created for more subjects and topics, it is likely to change the role of teachers, and hence, schooling may need to be reconceptualized. *ere exist many concerns and worries among teachers on if AI challenges their jobs. At the same time, such questions as what is being learned and how AI is being used are being discussed currently by researchers as well as by educational practitioners. Some researchers wondered whether ad- vancements in AI would challenge or even replace teachers since many other jobs are being replaced by automation [11]. *ere is an emerging recognition that teachers’ professional roles need to be adjusted as AI advances and this will trigger new organizational forms [12]. Emerging challenges also included students’ attitudes towards these changes [13]. To some extent, students as digital citizens are able to leverage AI to improve learning outcomes. Nonetheless, they may fail to use suitable AI techniques appropriately for a specific learning context, which would result in negative attitudes towards learning [14].
To summarize, this research involves a review of the studies of AI in education. Previous studies have included three essential perspectives of AI in knowledge processing: (a) knowledge representation, (b) knowledge obtaining, and (c) knowledge derivation [3]; this review will focus on AI techniques and tools that have been integrated into edu- cation recently after the proliferation of AI. *e “first generation” of AI could support human intellectual work by applying rule-based expert knowledge, and the “second generation” may find the optimal solution by statistical/ search model, while the “third generation” will dramatically improve recognition performance based on the brain model. *is review focuses on articles published in the period from 2010 to 2020 from the Web of Science, as that represents the period when the second and third generation of AI began to make headways into education. *e research questions that guided this review are as follows:
(1) What is the overall state of AI in education? Which research topics and research designs related to AI in education are evident from 2010 to 2020?
(2) What are the trends in published studies in terms of AI in education?
(3) What are the challenges generated from the current research of AI in education?
2. Method
*is study is a systematic literature review. *e objectives of the review were to analyze and interpret findings based on predefined research questions (see above) and criteria which serve to point out future directions [15]. *e predefined research foci as shown in Table 1 are research purpose, learning subject, educational level, research approach, and effects. *e review was conducted in three stages: planning, performing, and reporting the systematic review.
2.1.PlanningtheReview. AspreviousreviewsaboutAIwere conducted in the physical sciences [16, 17], the study aimed to conduct a review in the field of the social sciences.
*e Web of Science database and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals were selected for the search for desired articles published from 2010 to 2020. Articles published in the SSCI database are generally considered as high-quality publication among education researchers. *e keyword employed was “artificial intelligence,” and the subject area was refined to “education and educational re- search”. *is process yielded 142 articles including 121 re- search articles, 10 review papers, one interview paper, and 5 book reviews. *e selected articles include both analytic studies (primarily qualitative research) and empirical studies (primarily quantitative research).
2.2. Performing the Review. Following Wu et al. [18], this study was conducted in two steps: identification and coding. In the first step, an article was selected to the potential pool when it qualified for either of two criteria: (a) the research involved a specific AI technique as an intervention in assisting learning or teaching and (b) it provided empirical evidence or in-depth analysis. As already noted, only articles indexed in SSCI were considered. It should be noted that studies that focused on the development processes of AI without educational implications or only adopted AI as a learning subject without the employment of AI were ex- cluded from this review. Second, as for the analytic studies, only studies that discussed the effect of AI techniques on education were included. Each full text of all the identified papers was read and screened individually by three-panel members with doctoral degrees or professorships in the field of learning technology. Studies that did not fit clearly with the criteria were brought up for panel discussion. *e screening process yielded 100 articles out of the original set of 121.
In the second step, all the authors discussed thematic analysis principles and established a coding scheme in terms of how AI was used in education. Two main categories were investigated: research questions and technology adoption. Firstly, with regard to research questions, previous research has found three basic models of AI in knowledge processing: knowledge representation, knowledge obtaining, and knowledge derivation [3]. Building on that foundation, the

research questions of the sample papers were classified into three dimensions: (a) development, focusing on the knowledge presentation model; (b) extraction, centering on how to obtain knowledge from data mining; and (c) ap- plication, emphasizing the human-computer interaction through information derivation. Secondly, with regard to technology adoption, the focus was on the types of tech- nology that the study adopted, which were further catego- rized into software (e.g., algorithms and programs) and hardware (e.g., sensors and devices such as virtual reality). It should be noted that a study with technology without an AI purpose in education was not included. A detailed de- scription is shown in Table 1 and it includes learning subject, educational level, research approach, and effects. Moreover, the researchers conducted further frequency comparisons on the associations between the research purposes and some factors such as AI technology adoption as well as time periods to predict the trends and challenges of AI in education.
3. Findings and Discussion
According to the above coding criteria and content anal- ysis, the three dimensions of research questions are shown in Table 2 and the 72 studies from 63 empirical studies (5 papers have two studies and 2 papers have three studies) are further subclassified into 11 categories. *ere are 23 studies in the dimension of development. *e AI technique was utilized as a development tool for the construction of a smart learning environment, which can be subclassified as focusing on the development of algorithms including classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning for teaching and learning purposes. Additionally, 35 reviewed studies were found in the dimension of ex- traction, which referred to the application of developed AI techniques, normally based on algorithms, to offer students feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning. 14 empirical studies were found in the dimension of application which consisted of affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification. In the integration dimension, AI techniques included those involving human factors as vital variables to identify and analyze learners’ personalized features. In such studies, human-computer interaction was generated to improve such characteristics as creativity, responsibility, and critical thinking that can impact learners’ performances and perceptions. *e following sections describe what educational issues were dealt with in the age of AI and how AI technique was employed in each research question.
3.1. Dimension of Development. As shown in Table 2, 16 empirical studies were found focusing on the development of education systems such as intelligent tutoring system (ITS) and electronic assessment. *e development proce- dure was usually conducted with an induction-deduction approach, in which prior experiments and data were ana- lyzed to predict the variables followed by the algorithm testing to obtain the final modelling equation [19].
Generally, the development of an educational system is constituted of three components: the presentations, logical modelling, and data dimension [20]. All the 23 studies centered on logical modelling, while no study was found on the presentation methods or data mining. *e possible explanation may due to that the modelling techniques were the foundation of AI technique and fundamentally penetrate throughout the procedure of system development. In this dimension, the research was generally conducted in the domain of computer science or information science, and the domain knowledge as the source material was imported into algorithm frame (shown in Figure 1(a)) with few pedagogical designs reported. For example, Horakova et al. [3] aimed to explore the classification ability of a text mining machine using three classification techniques. *e results show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) were significantly more effective than regression trees and decision trees to separate educational texts or text fragments.
Additionally, in terms of the matching/group formation modelling, prior research employing stereotype theory has assessed that the Bayesian networks, association rules, clustering, fuzzy C-means, and the fuzzy and genetic al- gorithms were well-accepted algorithms for the modelling of individual properties of the student. *ese techniques provide potential indications for the investigation of forming homogeneous and heterogeneous groups in an educational context [21].
Moreover, the trends of the growing amount of data challenge educators to analyze qualitative data efficiently. Natural language processing (NLP) provided a means to diagnose the problem and make a recommendation by simplifying and accelerating the discovery of what lies within the data [22]. However, the assessment of a complex edu- cational system requires more profound information re- trieval. *e integration of multiple approaches, such as benchmark in NLP/Semantic Web field, was suggested to model smarter computer-aided systems in which agents could be trained automatically [23].
To optimize the modelling in the learning context, the hierarchical structures were considered as potential solu- tions to model the educational system. *is is because ed- ucation is generally a complex system with the exhibition of subsystems and components, in which the invisible causal processes among subsystem/component behaviours would causally affect each other [24]. It was suggested that sys- tematic modelling should analyze three dimensions in the education context: learner’s variation, learning domains, and learning activities [25, 26]. For example, some researchers constructed the higher-order item response theory frame- work involving the overall ability at the first dimension and multiple domain abilities at the second dimension, which has been well adopted in the automatic problem-solving process [27].
Based on the above and Nguyen and Yang’s suggestion [28], the aims of developing an AI-integrated system in education could be grouped into four types: classification (5 studies), matching (3 studies), recommendation (5 studies), and deep learning (10 studies). (1) Classification refers to the reconstruction of knowledge bases, in which the materials

could be categorized according to varied characteristics. Classification demarcates knowledge content, which con- tributes to the accuracy of text analysis [3]. For example, some researchers developed an ITS with the characteristics of categorizing motion problems, by which learners could easily access different types of motion problems in Math- ematics [29]. (2) Matching refers to a conversion mecha- nism, in which varied sets of classification are connected to specific learning purpose. For example, a text-to-diagram system was developed for blind students to link geometry words to an underlying diagram on the Braille printout, which has been certified as an effective teaching/learning tool at a Blind school [30]. (3) *e recommendation is regarded as an intelligent authoring tool. With the support of the natural language process, it could automatically create new themes, theories, and pedagogical contents as a re- sponse to learners’ feedback, to help teachers save time and effort [31]. It constructed a human-computer interaction and widely used to generate real-time and intelligent feedback according to learners’ input, which has been regarded as a reliable feature in modern assessment system [32]. (4) Deep learning, or machine learning, is a compre- hensive approach of big data processing and learning be- haviour analysis. Based on the proliferation of big data in education, such as learning or teaching behaviour, the system could self-adjust to meet users’ dynamic require- ments by upgrading its algorithms [33].
To date, some studies have reported the lack of signif- icant impact on improving teaching. *e challenge was largely attributed to the weak pedagogical design and lack of appropriate assessment criteria [8]. Future research should therefore be grounded in learning theories so that more acceptable, accessible, and efficacious AI can be an integral part of learners’ lives.
3.2. Dimension of Extraction. Educators have begun to ex- plore suitable applications of AI techniques in their teaching. *ere are currently some AI applications that have achieved the integration of technique, domain knowledge, and ped- agogical design. *e three types of pedagogical applications of AI identified in this review were feedback (16 studies), reasoning (10 studies), and adaptive learning (9 studies). While these applications could be interlinked, they were categorized as such based on the classification explicated by the authors of the reviewed articles.
3.2.1. Feedback. One of the challenges impairing person- alized learning is the inappropriate sequencing of contents. *e restructuring of presentation sequences is seeking a way to redefine the organization of knowledge according to the student’s reaction. In this situation, feedback is an important approach to meet learners’ proximal learning patterns [9]. Using an artificial neural network, the system provides immediate feedback according to students’ input to help them gradually get access to the abstract concepts and perform practical exercises. Besides, researchers perceived a positive trend towards the system, which may attribute to two perspectives.
(1) Based on Ohlsson’s theory, students can learn from the feedback generated as the result of an error [34]. In a physical teaching environment, the teacher could interact with students immediately as difficulties arise. It is, however, difficult for such just-in-time interaction in an online context. *e situation requires intelligent algorithms to provide feedback automatically. For example, with the help of pedagogical agent-based cognitive architecture, the in- telligent virtual laboratory was developed to give appropriate feedback to students who encounter difficulties in the lab- oratory [35]. Besides, a learning website, Jutge.org, was developed with the features of a rich and well-organized problem repository. *e website provides instant feedback and helps students to progressively solve problems and learn from their mistakes [36]. (2) Immediate feedback promotes active training in interactive learning environments that would benefit learner’s comprehension diagnosis [19]. *e previous study combined speech recognition, natural lan- guage processing, and machine learning to measure the quality of classroom talk, in which new forms of interaction were created to provoke thoughts and further shape the effective interaction of the learning environment [37]. Another AI system used path traversal algorithms to es- tablish causal chains, by which students were provided with elaborated feedback and hints rather than the correct an- swers. *e learning-by-teaching context was constructed by learners’ self-organization of interactions and their inter- pretation of feedback [38].
Although a large number of benefits were reported with respect to automated feedback of domain knowledge, no research in this review had established the connection to pedagogical theories. Most of the authors in the develop- ment dimensions were from the computer science domain, which leads to their focus on the presentation of source data (domain knowledge) technically without much pedagogical consideration.
3.2.2. AI-Supported Reasoning. *e recursive feedback may have the potential to foster learners’ abilities to reason in specific ways because the human-computer interaction is able to engender among the students a sense of responsibility toward improving the construction of knowledge repository [39]. *e reconstruction of the knowledge repository was seen as a process of using modelling to realize pedagogical design as shown in Figure 1(b). However, some researchers found that novices such as students and preservice teachers showed minimal understanding of the invisible causal be- haviours in the system compared to experts and experienced teachers [24]. Another research showed a similar conclusion: students were able to learn the relevant facts and pairwise relations, while they may still fail to reason with them very well [39]. One possible explanation could be that reasoning is largely invisible and it is difficult to induce the processes of reasoning through the observation of the behaviours. AI techniques such as the visualization technique could be applied to foster learners’ reasoning.
To help learners improve their reasoning, the graph structure [29] and learners’ engagement [24] techniques

have been studied. For the graph structure, intelligent sys- tems could be developed to make thinking visible. In a sense, the simulation approach of the AI technique was employed to mimic thoughts tracking the reasoning visually in real time. For example, the argument-mapping tools were designed to assist learners with visualization of the premises and conclusions of arguments. *e findings showed that a sequence of connected arguments was chained together for learners to make an ultimate conclusion [40]. Drawing from the sociocultural theories of learning in designing AI to support students’ reasoning, Vattam et al. [24] reported that engaged learners could better understand the multiple levels of organization in complex systems. *erefore, students’ engagement is an essential aspect to be considered for the design of a learning system that aims to support reasoning.
*e hierarchical reasoning generated by the intelligent system had beneficial effects on students’ learning. Firstly, it may help learners to optimize the elucidation of the rela- tionships between the subcomponents of a particular topic. In return, the intelligent reasoning system can be used as a form of evaluation to assess if the student has captured enough concepts for the given topic [41]. Secondly, the system could provide an argumentative interaction which placed great significance in the construction of collaborative learning atmosphere. It is because, as a result of peers’ reasoning, learners tend to externalize their arguments and improve their premises. Jain et al. [41] combined visualized mapping tool with collaboration scripts. *e design suc- cessfully helped learners to analyze and evaluate opposing positions on contentious topics. Generally, researchers regarded the reasoning visualization tools as valuable scaffolds to develop learners’ critical thinking and writing [40].
However, using AI techniques, including visualization and hierarchical reasoning modelling, may be inadequate to support reasoning. *e four studies reviewed focused on the utilization of modelling to support general reasoning, while the reasoning model should be largely domain-specific [24, 39, 40, 42]. Moreover, there is an unresolved challenge in coding learners’ behaviours as far as AI-supported rea- soning is concerned. *e reasoning process may be more effective when learners’ personalized performance is con- sidered. Although the visualized reasoning tools could perform well in a small-scale group setting, it is difficult to obtain adequate reasoning analysis of the data from a large population because the reasoning system fails to adjust itself automatically. *erefore, the requirements of dealing with increasingly large and diverse data demand self-adaptive alternatives [9].
3.2.3. Adaptive Learning. Based on the new decentralized theories of AI and social cognition, the apparent complexity of learners’ behaviour was largely a reflection of the com- plexity of the learning environments. *is prompted edu- cators to provide adaptive scaffolds for diversified learning environments with various types of learners. Different from the feedback system that offers stock responses, the adaptive educational system is a formative and corrective automated
system that can adjust itself (target of intervention) to suit individual learners’ characteristics, needs, and preferences (pedagogical objective) [43]. Although only three empirical studies were identified in this review, some researchers were very positive to the future promotion of adaptive system in teaching and learning. Technologies such as intelligent speech recognition and automated writing evaluation [44] have been tested with promising findings. In addition, there was substantial evidence showing that adaptive intelligence enhances learning by automatically enabling learners to locate and access proximal educational resources with re- spect to navigation and presentation support [45].
Previous research has emphasized that the design di- mension was a worth exploring alternative in the appli- cation of adaptive system [46]. To design successful adaptive systems in education, curriculum designers and system designers have to leverage on to include the modelling of the problem-solving process in the specific domain knowledge and the use of big data [21, 44]. Firstly, the mechanism of the adaptive system connects learners’ prior domain knowledge and the evaluation of their current domain performance to scaffold their problem-solving [47]. In particular, the pedagogical design is essential in adaptive intelligent context. It involves the selection of adaptive algorithms and considerations about the com- patibility of the learning style and the intelligence sup- portive methods. In this sense, the assumption that AI would threaten the teachers’ position may be unfounded because of teachers’ vital role as curriculum designers. Secondly, the adaptive system is empowered by big data. Since the main feature of the adaptive learning system is personalization, accumulation of big data such as the range of diverse individual characteristics and learning style and preferences is necessary for intelligent personalization to be realized. However, research on personalization in the context of the adaptive system is limited to the users’ characteristics related to domain knowledge. *e deeper internal characters, such as human mental status and creativity, were barely noticed and studied [21]. *is however has vital research potential with the development of advanced AI techniques such as biofeedback techniques.
3.3. Dimension of Application
3.3.1. Technology Adoption in the Application Dimension.
*e dimension of application highlights the importance of including human affection in the application of AI in ed- ucation. *e latest research has indicated that affection had increasingly been reported to exert a significant influence on decision-making, perception, and learning [48]. Previous studies on the measurement of learning performance only focused on two dimensions: learning outcomes (e.g., scoring and achievement) and perceptions (e.g., satisfaction and acceptance), whereas other aspects were less noticed. Based on the maturity of biofeedback technique, such as eye- tracking and EEG, affection computing was increasingly adopted to investigate students' internal motivations on learning, such as creativity and responsibility [49, 50].

According to the content analysis of the selected papers shown in Table 1, there are five typical AI techniques that supported affection computing and analysis in the education sector. *ey are complex algorithms, visualization, XR (virtual/augmented/mixed reality), wearable technique, and neuroscience. In many situations, they supported each other to construct a smart learning environment and system. (1) Complex algorithms were designed with consideration of human factors rather than the simple combination of functional blocks. From the perspective of human-computer interaction, the learners should be treated as a knowledge creator rather than the receiver, which helps to generate positive affection status. From the perspective of presenta- tion modes, the traditional declarative statements in a computer system should be replaced by more diversified verbal presentations such as dialogue, coaching, and gen- erality. (2) Visualization was seen as an optimal method chosen for the solution of complex conception. One of the benefits of visualization is making complex knowledge en- tertaining, such as game-based learning, in which learners’ motivation will be greatly generated. (3) XR including virtual/augmented/mixed reality provides a highly simulated learning context, which may be challenging to realize in physical classrooms. For example, to help learners under- stand complex landforms in geography, XR indulges stu- dents into a lively and creative status. (4) *e wearable technique, such as Google glasses, helps to integrate learning activity into somatosensory moves. Although it was still in an exploratory period, it has great potential to advance domain knowledge in a practical context in daily life. (5) Modern neuroscience exploits how the brain works and this expands the research of learning to include the learners’ physiological state. Research in this area would enrich un- derstanding about individual variations and could provide additional avenues to match instruction with the most optimal guidance.
3.3.2. :e Categories of the Application Dimension. With the supports of the above five AI techniques, four types of learning models were generated with the application of affection analysis, which was biofeedback (6 studies), role- playing (2 studies), immersive learning (2 studies), and gamification (4 studies).
Affection computing refers to the analysis of human emotions and feelings captured by physical sensors and affective algorithms, which has gained much attention in recent years. Affection computing enhanced human-com- puter interaction. Based on the facial identification, some researchers improved the intelligent tutoring system by which students’ emotional status was detected to give them timely emotional feedback [51]. Two essential aspects are needed to optimize the affection computing technique: first, teachers have to make timely appropriate instructional adjustments according to learners’ affective status; second, comprehensive operation of multimode affection sources as a single source is unlikely to provide accurate analysis of affection. For example, the eye-tracking technique could capture learners’ eye fixation to track the attended area, but
the reasons for the foci may be attributed to different af- fections such as interest, anxiety, or even distraction. An additional source of data such as EEG could help to make a more accurate assessment [52].
Role-play is a learning method that inspires students to ponder on problems with affections assuming varied roles. Some algorithms were designed with the integration of role- play into the pedagogical design, where students are taught by an intelligent agent rather than being taught by the learning system [39]. Enlisting role-play can enhance learners’ investment in their interactions with computers. More than that, learners’ sense of responsibility was exerted towards the intelligent agent, which was consistent with the research from Chase et al., demonstrating that students may work harder on behalf of their agents than they would for themselves [53]. Additionally, to motivate students to act as a companion to an intelligent agent, the politeness pre- sentation mode was employed in the intelligent tutoring systems, which was observed to benefit the needy students [54]. *e future research of role-play may focus on granting access to students so that they could customize their roles and target agents.
Immersive learning is an approach that enables students to customize scenes of characters engaging in full-view learning settings. *e enhancement of XR, 3D graphics, and wearable devices could promote the learning performance and these are strongly related to immersive affection, which generated students’ academic performance and positive perceptions, such as excitement, enthusiasm, and creativity. For example, learners could obtain a high degree of ex- citement in the immersive learning environment. Immersive environment can also be coupled with immersive collabo- ration with gestures, emotions, and nonverbal communi- cation [14]. Using immersive learning may also reduce students’ sense of being intimidated by complex topics and technical concepts when they expose to simulated techno- logical and computing issues [55]. Most importantly, many immersive learning tools encourage learners’ enthusiasm to create and change the environments, which could foster creativity [56]. However, few studies were found to consider domain knowledge as a variable. *e possible reason may be that many immersive learning tools were in the explorative stage. Further investigations in specific domains are eagerly needed.
Gamification has emerged as an important theoretical notion in the education sector. *e most successful ed- ucational games tightly integrate the pedagogical design, domain knowledge, and affection elements with game- play. AI has assisted the integration of the game and knowledge domain, and the further potential is making the game adapt to the learners’ behaviours and affections dynamically [57]. One of the examples appropriately integrating domain knowledge with affection is Minecraft Edu. *is is a historical simulation game where students can learn about historical figures and events or get insight into the spread of epidemics. Learners could get access to historical events with authentic emotions in the real-time interaction, and the collateral emotion would help them better understand the specific content knowledge [8].

Another example employed a game reward system as motivational mechanisms to promote voluntary and proactive learning. *e results showed that the reward system had a desirable fit with the pedagogical design, and the future educational algorithms might better get asso- ciated with the field of artificial intelligence to motivate emergent learning [58].
3.4. :e Results from Qualitative Research. According to selected qualitative research (as shown in Table 3), the exploration of AI in education experienced a process from theoretical research to a specific practice field, and at last back to review. Simultaneously, qualitative research also provided support for the development of quantitative research throughout the whole process. Some theoretical studies were at the forefront. For example, in 2011 and 2012, qualitative research on decentralized theory [43] and swarm intelligence [59] appeared, and then the real artificial intelligence research began. AI algorithms were not very mature at the beginning while advanced intel- ligent algorithms are usually based on big data technology, and they could constantly learn and improve in the massive data. *e big data must be decentralized and group-oriented. *erefore, we believe that the early the- oretical research has played a significant supporting role. In 2019, researchers attached more emphasis on the summary of previous studies and prospects for future development, and more consideration will be given to the status quo, future, and possible problems of AI in various sectors of education.
4. The Research Trends of AI in Education
4.1. Technology Adoption of Internet of :ings. *e existing research mainly focused on the virtual online system, and the Internet of *ings (IoT) is less noticed. Learners’ bio- feedback also needs to be explored in future educational research. According to the reviewed papers, a majority of AI technology in education focused on online information technology or system (107 out of 109), such as intelligent tutoring system, intelligent virtual laboratory, and assess- ment system. Only one study [55] employed a wearable circuit to examine learners’ biofeedback. *is may be at- tributed to the fact that the intelligent online system is well established, easier to build on, and cost-effective. However, to cater to diverse learning contents and varied learning skills, the IoT holds much promise. It may enhance students’ spatial and mechanical understanding of physical con- struction processes in science education. *e IoT technology can simulate brain functions in physical context to sense and understand human’s cognitive behaviours, which apparently optimizes human cognition and performance in two qual- itative studies [33, 60]. Although no empirical studies in the selected papers were found to test the effect of IoT technique on education, the IoT with affordable costs and wearable computing devices could be a potential area of future de- velopment of AI in education. *is is consistent with the Horizon report in 2019.

4.2. Swarm Intelligence in Education. Swarm intelligence has become a vital development direction of AI, where the roles of teachers and students will be disruptively changed. According to the selected papers, the decentralized theory was firstly investigated in education in 2011 [43], followed by the introduction of swarm intelligence in education in 2012 [59]. However, no empirical study has explored how teachers and students meet the challenges brought by swarm intelligence. It is predicted that the following two topics may become the research trends according to the features of swarm intelligence. Firstly, swarm intelligence does not rely on centralized control of individual behaviours. In this situation, learners change from knowledge absorbers to creators. *ey actively constructed knowledge by interfacing with the system in a variety of contexts. Teachers’

“authorities” may be challenged by a group of experienced practitioners such as engineers and farmers, and a collab- orative curriculum design would be constructed by swarm intelligence system [45]. Moreover, swarm intelligence may change teachers’ duties from knowledge transmission to knowledge organization. Previous research has suggested the exploration of crowdfunding or crowdsourcing by teachers on education, and how teachers perform their organizing ability in the future [5]. However, as Figure 2 presents, the investigation from teachers’ perspective is still inadequate, which needs further study. Secondly, swarm intelligence facilitated adaptivity in dynamic or unstable environments. Swarm agents usually exchange information by leaving marks and observing the activities of their peers. For ex- ample, the best solution in the current moment may become unavailable in the next moment. *erefore, it is suggested to invest further how AI performs dynamic recommendation for students on different learning progress [59].
4.3. Deep Learning and Neurocomputation. Deep learning or machine learning will reshape the interactions between human beings and machines in the future. *e trends of human-computer interaction will no longer be based on the perspective of machine operation by a human. Instead, the machine can improve predictions by learning from big data without being specifically programmed. Two studies on deep learning were first mentioned in the selected papers in 2017 [23, 32]. In 2018, one empirical study [37] was published and it focused the deep learning technology on the modelling of scoring-based data. However, the data based on human’s physical features were less noticed. Based on the basis of neuroscientific understanding of the brain, Pearson and IBM have proposed to investigate neurocomputation brain-based educational technologies [33]. However, only two qualitative studies [33, 60] suggested the integration of neuroscience and AI in the education sector. Future research trends in integrating brain function with deep learning techniques to optimize human-computer interaction could be expected. It will influence the application and integration of AI in ed- ucation, such as adaptive learning and role-play. *is view has been reported in the Horizon report in 2018. Specifically, the report forecasts that adaptive learning techniques will be further generalized in two to three years.
4.4. Evaluation of AI in Education. All empirical studies reviewed presented the positive effects of AI techniques on education (see Table 1). However, the interview and the review paper have, respectively, surfaced the challenges or misunderstanding of AI in education [4, 21]. *ere is a need to articulate a holistic evaluation criterion to measure the effectiveness of AI in education. To ensure the validity and reliability of the evaluation, a multidimensional model should be adopted, which includes technique, pedagogical design, domain knowledge, and human factors. Woolf’s [119] Roadmap for Education Technology predicted that in the era of AI Educational Data Mining, the lifelong as- sessment of students’ knowledge, their progress, and the
environments where they learn, as well as the success and failure in teaching strategies, can be chronologically tracked. Besides, current research is disproportionately focused on specific educational contexts and a handful of variables. As shown in Figure 2, most research sampled students as par- ticipants, while teachers and professor practitioners were less noticed; additionally, most researchers considered science, humanity, and social science as subjects, but less attention was paid to sports, arts, and special education. For example, only one study was found to develop text-to-diagram conversion as
a novel teaching aid for blind learners [30].
5. The Challenges AI Confronted in Education
AI is a promising field that faces many technology bottle- necks. *e challenges would be more complex and intricate, especially when they are connected to an application in education. *e challenges this review identifies could be classified into three categories: technique, teachers and students, and social ethics.
Although AI techniques displayed and predicted smart computation in the education domain, they generally fail to bring “added-value” to large-scale students because of the concern of costs, and the mainstream is still occupied by “basic value” [38]. Specifically, some researchers found that many AI techniques were designed for a general situation that could not address the needs of a particular domain, specific learning activities, or teaching goals. *is would prevent the actualization of personalized learning experi- ences [8, 120].
Another great challenge reported in the Horizon report in 2018 is the reconceptualization of the role of educators. Teachers’ attitudes towards AI have a significant influence on the effectiveness of using AI in education. Teachers may swing from total resistance to overreliance. *e former could arise from inadequate, inappropriate, irrelevant, or outdated professional development. *e latter may be due to teachers’ unrealistic expectations. *ese teachers may focus too much on the emerging AI technologies rather than learning itself [44]. Additionally, from the perspective of students, AI technique may provide smart and efficient tools that cause students to avoid doing the knowledge processing work that teachers expect them to do. For example, the AI translators may offer ready-made illustrations, pronunciation, fixed phrases, and even a serial of examples. Students are thus unwilling to engage in the inquiry processes that facilitate deep learning.
*e ethical issues brought by AI are also challenging for both researchers and educational practitioners. It was clear that AI has made great strides over the past few years, mostly because of cheaper processing and the availability of data; however, individual student data may be exposed, shared, or used inappropriately. It is a constantly mindful challenge that educators and AI engineers will face when considering how we access, evaluate, and share the big data and the results of data analysis [44, 65]. Another ethical debate was conspicuously found in gamification that emphasis should be put on learning and tend to “suck the fun out” of games, or on gameplay “suck out the learning” [57].

6. Conclusions
Given the rapid growth of AI, there is an urgent need to understand how educators can best utilize AI techniques for the academic success of students. *is paper reviewed AI in education research from 2010 to 2020. It is found that the research to date could be classified into three dimensions: the dimension of development including classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning; the di- mension of an extraction involving feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning; and the dimension of application in- cluding affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification. Moreover, based on the research questions and the related AI techniques, four research trends were identified. *ey are the Internet of *ings, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of the effect of AI in education. *e challenges of AI in education were also conspicuously seen in terms of technique perspective, teachers’ and students’ roles, and social ethical issues. *ese findings could be valuable ref- erences for educational researchers, students, and AI de- velopers who plan to contribute to the relevant studies. Furthermore, it seems clear that educators need to work with AI engineers to address the gaps between technique and pedagogy.
7. Limitations and Future Study
Although this review does propose some valuable trends and potential research directions for AI in education, there exist several limitations. Firstly, the papers reviewed in this study were filtered from Social Science Citation Index, while other databases on natural science (e.g., SCOPUS and EI) and sources (e.g., reports, news, conference papers, and patents) could be involved to offer a more comprehensive overview in this field. For instance, articles from the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education that has pub- lished 30 volumes were not considered. *is review therefore is limited only to SSCI articles. Additionally, the initial search could be extended using more keywords such as adaptive learning and tutor system, which may lead to the

latest technical reports of AI in education that were not included in this paper. Secondly, since the current review was not attempted to be inclusive but to provide a systematic overview of AI in education, the analysis in this review may provide a framework for future research integration. For example, a more formal meta-analysis could be conducted on selected empirical studies that reported effect sizes to see what impact on learning AI might be having. Besides, the future analysis could go back further in time to see if there were changes about the time that AI 2.0 started to make headways into education.
