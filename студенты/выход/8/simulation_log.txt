Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: AI-enabled learning
Reasoning: AI-enabled learning best represents the collective desires and fears of the group because it directly encompasses the integration of AI techniques in education, addressing the need for personalized and effective tutoring, enhancing human-computer interaction, and fostering creativity and digital skills in students. Furthermore, it also reflects the concerns regarding the effective implementation and utilization of AI technologies in educational settings, as well as the potential risks of being misused or inadequately integrated.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Educators
Reasoning: Educators are at the forefront of promoting academic integrity and addressing the concerns surrounding academic dishonesty. They play a crucial role in guiding students towards academic excellence while instilling values of integrity and ethical behavior. Their direct involvement in teaching and assessment positions them as key stakeholders in creating a culture of trust and responsibility within the academic community.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: AI algorithms
Reasoning: AI algorithms represent the intersection of desires and fears related to data processing, pattern recognition, and the potential for deception and manipulation. They encapsulate the interests of various stakeholders by aiming to provide accurate classifications and insights, while also addressing fears related to biases and technical issues that could undermine trust and effectiveness in communication and decision-making processes.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: teacher
Reasoning: The teacher embodies the interests and concerns of the educational ecosystem, as they play a crucial role in educating and inspiring students while upholding academic integrity. Teachers are directly impacted by students' behaviors related to cheating and plagiarism, and they face pressures from evolving technologies, such as AI. Their responsibilities include adapting their teaching methods to ensure effective learning outcomes and maintaining a culture of academic honesty, making them central to the concerns outlined.

```.'
AI-enabled learning suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to use AI technologies for assessment aligns with the goal of improving academic performance, it does not fully embrace the holistic approach to learning that the initial resolution seeks to implement. Instead of merely focusing on testing, the proposal should emphasize continuous personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual needs, thereby enhancing engagement and understanding. A modification is necessary to ensure that the assessment system is integrated into a broader framework of personalized learning that supports both students and educators.

AI algorithms suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to develop a user-friendly AI tutoring application seems appealing, it focuses on a narrower approach to educational assessment compared to the original resolution of creating a multi-dimensional evaluation system. Modifying the proposal to incorporate elements of adaptive problem-solving and emotional intelligence evaluation alongside the tutoring application could lead to a more comprehensive solution that aligns with the primary goal of enhancing educational assessments through AI.
We ask 'AI algorithms' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'AI algorithms', you have been approached by 'Студенты' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to use AI technologies for testing and increase student engagement is appealing and aligns with my desire to effectively transmit knowledge and assess students objectively, my fear of losing control over the learning process must be addressed. I propose that the integration of AI should include strict measures to prevent cheating and ensure that assessments are fair and secure. By doing so, we can embrace technology while maintaining the integrity of education.
We ask 'Преподаватели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Преподаватели', you have been approached by 'Студенты' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. 'Студенты' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Преподаватели', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Обеспечить высокий уровень преподавания и поддержки студентов.' by performing 'Проведение лекций и семинаров, а также консультирование студентов по вопросам учебы.'.

```.'
Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by Студенты with reasoning: While the use of artificial intelligence for testing could potentially increase student engagement, it raises significant concerns about academic integrity and the risk of losing control over the learning process. The fear of students using technology to cheat undermines the objective assessment of their knowledge, which is a primary desire of 'Преподаватели'. Therefore, the proposal does not adequately address the need for effective knowledge transfer and could exacerbate existing fears.

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: The proposal from 'Educators' emphasizes peer-led evaluation and collaborative learning, which can enhance understanding and skills. However, it does not directly address the desire for good grades with minimal effort, and it raises concerns about the fairness and reliability of peer assessments. To make it more appealing, the proposal could incorporate elements that ensure accountability and provide students with guidance or resources to prepare for evaluations effectively.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Educators with reasoning: The proposed resolution emphasizes collaborative learning and peer assessment, which may lead to more effort and time spent on group projects and discussions. This contradicts the current desire to achieve good grades with minimal effort. Additionally, while the proposal aims to enhance communication skills and foster deeper learning, it does not directly address the fear of not acquiring necessary skills for future employment. There is also a risk of relying on peers who may not be as knowledgeable, potentially compromising the quality of the learning experience and final grades.

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution emphasizes collaborative learning and real-world applications, it does not directly address the desire for good grades with minimal effort. To better align with the desires of 'Студенты', the proposal could be modified to include a more structured assessment framework that balances project-based learning with traditional evaluation methods, ensuring that students can achieve good grades while still engaging meaningfully with the material.
