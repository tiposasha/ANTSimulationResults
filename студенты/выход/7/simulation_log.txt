Academic Integrity declined the resolution proposed by Студенты with reasoning: The proposed scenario of using AI technologies for testing undermines the core principles of academic integrity. While it may enhance awareness of integrity policies, it does not align with the goal of maintaining high standards of honesty and integrity among students. Allowing AI to play a role in testing could lead to increased opportunities for dishonesty and diminish the value of authentic assessment. Therefore, this proposal does not benefit the desires of 'Academic Integrity' and poses significant risks to the integrity of academic evaluations.
We ask 'Преподаватели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Преподаватели', you have been approached by 'Студенты' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to use AI technologies for testing could enhance student engagement and provide a more accurate measure of knowledge, it raises concerns about the potential for academic dishonesty and losing control over the educational process. To proceed, I suggest incorporating strict guidelines and monitoring systems to ensure that the implementation of AI tools does not compromise academic integrity. Additionally, involving both students and faculty in the development of these AI-driven methods can help maintain a balance of control and ensure alignment with educational goals.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Academic Integrity with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Academic Integrity' does not align with the desires of 'Студенты' to achieve good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort. While it aims to ensure academic integrity, it imposes a collaborative model that may require more engagement and effort from students than they desire. Additionally, the reliance on a plagiarism detection tool may increase fear of being caught for those who resort to dishonest methods, rather than fostering an environment for authentic learning. Hence, the proposal does not adequately address the core interests of 'Студенты'.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal aims to foster a culture of academic integrity and allows for student involvement in assessment creation, it raises concerns about maintaining control over the learning process and ensuring objective evaluation. To address these fears, the proposal should include specific measures to safeguard against potential misuse of collaborative assessments, such as guidelines for content creation and evaluation criteria that align with academic integrity standards.

We ask 'Студенты' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Студенты', you have been approached by 'Zeta-7' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'Студенты' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Использовать технологии искусственного интеллекта для прохождения тестирования'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Zeta-7 with reasoning: The proposed resolution shifts the focus from traditional assessment methods to a decentralized system, which may not guarantee good grades with minimal effort. While earning 'knowledge tokens' through real-world projects sounds beneficial, it requires active participation and engagement, potentially increasing the workload. Additionally, there's a risk of not acquiring necessary skills if the peer-review process is not robust. This contradicts my current desire for good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort, and it does not mitigate my fear of lacking essential career skills.

Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by Zeta-7 with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to create a decentralized knowledge validation system that could enhance student engagement and participation, it also introduces a reliance on technology that could undermine my desire to effectively transmit knowledge and objectively assess students. Additionally, the potential for losing control over the learning process due to new technologies raises concerns about academic integrity and the validity of assessments. Therefore, this proposal does not align with my current desires and fails to adequately address my fears.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the 'Knowledge Odyssey' platform presents an innovative way to engage students and assess their knowledge application, it raises concerns regarding the potential for academic dishonesty and the loss of control over the assessment process. To align with the desire to effectively transfer knowledge and objectively assess students, the proposal should incorporate measures to ensure academic integrity and structured oversight. Additionally, integrating formative assessments should include strategies that allow for monitoring student progress closely and maintaining educator influence in the learning process.
