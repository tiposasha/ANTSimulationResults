It emphasizes adaptive and personalized learning experiences, which resonate with the systematic evaluation and improvement of educational practices. Other entities, such as Преподаватели and Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей, while important, are more human-centric and do not embody the technological and innovative aspects that 'Система оценивания' represents. Adaptive Learning Assessor (8) is also a close fit but is more specific and less comprehensive than the broader concept of AI-enabled learning."
