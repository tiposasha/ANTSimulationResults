Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Survey researchers with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Survey Researchers' does not align with my primary desire to achieve good grades and gain useful knowledge with minimal effort. Participating in the survey and providing feedback does not directly enhance my learning experience or provide me with the necessary skills for future employment. Additionally, there is a concern that this approach may not adequately address my fear of not obtaining the skills needed for future work, as it seems to focus more on self-reported experiences rather than actual knowledge application or assessment.

Resolution created by Работодатели: **Resolution:** As 'Работодатели', establish a collaborative industry-academic consortium that directly involves employers in the assessment process by designing and implementing competency-based evaluations that simulate real workplace challenges, ensuring that student assessments directly align with current industry standards and workforce needs, thereby creating a seamless transition from education to employment and making 'Работодатели' indispensable in shaping future-ready graduates.
Recruited participants: ['Студенты', 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей', 'AI-enabled learning', 'Survey researchers']
We ask 'Студенты' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Студенты', you have been approached by 'Работодатели' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'Студенты' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'AI-enabled learning' with the description: '**Resolution:** Develop an AI-driven adaptive assessment platform that continuously personalizes and evolves evaluation criteria based on individual learning patterns and cognitive abilities, providing a dynamic and accurate reflection of each student's true understanding and skills while fostering an ethical learning environment.'.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Работодатели with reasoning: The proposed resolution does not align with the current desires of 'Студенты' to achieve good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort. While it offers networking opportunities and the potential for increased employability, it places more responsibility on students to engage actively with industry professionals and participate in events, which may require additional effort and time. Additionally, there is a fear of being unprepared for real-world challenges, and the focus on competency-based evaluations might not guarantee the acquisition of necessary skills without adequate support and resources. Therefore, this proposal does not adequately address the desires and fears of 'Студенты'.

Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Работодатели' to establish a collaborative industry-academic consortium presents an opportunity to enhance the alignment of education with industry needs, it raises concerns about the potential overshadowing of pedagogical standards by employer priorities. Therefore, I propose modifying the resolution to ensure that while employers are involved in the assessment process, the input from educators remains central in maintaining high educational standards and adapting to new technologies. This would help us achieve our desires while addressing our fears about losing relevance in traditional teaching methods.

Resolution created by Academic Integrity: **Resolution:** As 'Academic Integrity', develop a blockchain-based credentialing system that securely records and verifies each student's learning journey and skill acquisition through micro-assessments, enabling a transparent, tamper-proof, and comprehensive reflection of genuine knowledge and capabilities, thus revolutionizing how educational achievements are recognized and valued.
Recruited participants: ['Работодатели', 'Студенты', 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей', 'AI-enabled learning']
We ask 'Работодатели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Работодатели', you have been approached by 'Academic Integrity' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'.

Работодатели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the blockchain-based credentialing system proposed by 'Academic Integrity' addresses concerns about verifying candidates' actual skills and knowledge, it shifts the focus to academic integrity principles rather than directly ensuring competency in real-world tasks. 'Работодатели' desires to recruit skilled graduates with practical abilities and fears hiring candidates whose diplomas may not reflect their true capabilities. Therefore, I suggest modifying the proposal to integrate a practical assessment component alongside the credentialing system, ensuring that students are evaluated on skills relevant to the workplace.

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the blockchain-based credentialing system has potential to provide a transparent and secure way to reflect genuine knowledge, it may still require significant effort from students to engage in micro-assessments and maintain academic integrity. To align better with the desire for good grades with minimal effort, the proposal could be modified to include a more supportive framework that reduces the burden on students while providing recognition for collaborative learning and independent study. Additionally, incorporating incentives for achieving milestones and recognizing different learning styles could make the proposal more appealing.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Academic Integrity with reasoning: While the proposal aims to maintain academic integrity and provide a transparent credentialing system, it does not align with 'Студенты' desires for achieving good grades with minimal effort. The emphasis on micro-assessments and the need for strict adherence to academic integrity policies might lead to increased pressure and workload, making it more challenging to obtain good grades. Additionally, there is a fear of being caught cheating, which the proposal does not alleviate, as it still requires a commitment to ethical practices that may not align with the desire for easier pathways to success.

We ask 'Преподаватели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Преподаватели', you have been approached by 'Survey researchers' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'Преподаватели' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'teacher' with the description: '**Initiator: Teacher**  
**Resolution:** Integrate experiential learning modules that immerse students in real-world problem-solving scenarios, allowing them to demonstrate and apply their knowledge in practical contexts, thereby ensuring assessments reflect genuine understanding and skills. To address potential concerns regarding the integrity of assessments and the misuse of technology, specific measures will be implemented: 

1. Establish clear guidelines for the use of technology during experiential learning activities to ensure it supports learning objectives without facilitating academic dishonesty.

2. Implement secure assessment methods that verify individual student contributions and understanding, such as reflective journals, peer assessments, and oral presentations.

3. Provide training for both educators and students on ethical technology use and academic integrity, emphasizing the importance of honesty in the learning process.

4. Regularly review and adapt assessment strategies to incorporate feedback and emerging technologies while maintaining rigorous standards for academic integrity.

By incorporating these measures, we can enhance experiential learning while safeguarding the credibility of assessments and promoting a culture of integrity.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Survey researchers' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Преподаватели', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance student engagement in academic activities' by performing 'Conducting interactive lectures and workshops'.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Survey researchers' aims to enhance student participation in surveys and offers a method to personalize assessments, it raises concerns about maintaining control over the learning process and the potential for misuse of technology. Therefore, I propose modifications to ensure that any adaptive surveys are designed with robust security measures to prevent academic dishonesty and that they align closely with the existing learning objectives. Additionally, integrating feedback from both students and educators will ensure the process remains transparent and effective.

Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by Survey researchers with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Survey researchers' offers a method to enhance data collection and analysis through adaptive surveys, it compromises 'Преподаватели's' ability to effectively control the learning process. The integration of new technologies could lead to potential misuse and academic dishonesty, which is a primary concern. The desire to objectively assess students and maintain the integrity of the learning environment outweighs the benefits of implementing a system that could further complicate assessment integrity.
