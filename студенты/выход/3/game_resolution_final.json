To address potential concerns regarding the integrity of assessments and the misuse of technology, specific measures will be implemented: \n\n1. Establish clear guidelines for the use of technology during experiential learning activities to ensure it supports learning objectives without facilitating academic dishonesty.\n\n2. Implement secure assessment methods that verify individual student contributions and understanding, such as reflective journals, peer assessments, and oral presentations.\n\n3. Provide training for both educators and students on ethical technology use and academic integrity, emphasizing the importance of honesty in the learning process.\n\n4. Regularly review and adapt assessment strategies to incorporate feedback and emerging technologies while maintaining rigorous standards for academic integrity.\n\nBy incorporating these measures, we can enhance experiential learning while safeguarding the credibility of assessments and promoting a culture of integrity.",
