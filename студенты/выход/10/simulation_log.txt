Resolution by Zeta-7 has collapsed due to lack of participants.
Resolution created by Работодатели: Initiator: Работодатели, Resolution: Develop a dynamic, real-world problem-solving internship program where students are assessed based on their ability to apply knowledge in practical workplace scenarios, ensuring assessments reflect genuine understanding and skills applicable to industry needs.
Recruited participants: ['Студенты', 'Преподаватели', 'AI-enabled learning', 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей']
We ask 'Студенты' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Студенты', you have been approached by 'Работодатели' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'Студенты' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Использовать технологии искусственного интеллекта для прохождения тестирования'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Работодатели' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Студенты', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Получение знаний и навыков для карьерного роста' by performing 'Участие в учебных курсах и практиках'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: Работодатели, Resolution: Develop a dynamic, real-world problem-solving internship program where students are assessed based on their ability to apply knowledge in practical workplace scenarios, ensuring assessments reflect genuine understanding and skills applicable to industry needs.', you as 'Студенты' will be able to achieve 'Увеличение трудоустройства среди студентов' by performing 'Участие в стажировках и карьерных ярмарках' using 'Создание партнерств с работодателями для организации стажировок и карьерных мероприятий' that 'Работодатели' will control.

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed internship program does address the need for practical assessment and skills applicable to the industry, it places control in the hands of 'Работодатели', which could lead to a misalignment with the interests and needs of 'Студенты'. To ensure that 'Студенты' can still achieve good grades and acquire useful knowledge with minimal effort, the proposal should include clear guidelines on how assessments are conducted, ensuring they are fair and beneficial for students. Additionally, it should incorporate opportunities for students to provide feedback on the program and ensure that the internships offered truly align with their educational goals.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Работодатели with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Работодатели' focuses on practical application and real-world problem-solving through internships, which requires active participation and genuine understanding. This contradicts the desire of 'Студенты' to achieve good grades and acquire useful knowledge with minimal effort. Additionally, it does not address the fear of being caught for academic dishonesty, as the emphasis on real-world assessments may make it harder to hide a lack of skills or knowledge.
We ask 'Преподаватели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Преподаватели', you have been approached by 'Работодатели' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'Преподаватели' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Academic Integrity' with the description: 'Implement a system of peer-to-peer knowledge assessments, where students evaluate each other's understanding through collaborative projects and discussions, thereby fostering a more accurate and integrity-driven reflection of their true capabilities and grasp of the subject matter.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Работодатели' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Преподаватели', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance teaching methodologies and improve student engagement.' by performing 'Developing new lesson plans and interactive activities.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: Работодатели, Resolution: Develop a dynamic, real-world problem-solving internship program where students are assessed based on their ability to apply knowledge in practical workplace scenarios, ensuring assessments reflect genuine understanding and skills applicable to industry needs.', you as 'Преподаватели' will be able to achieve 'Align teaching strategies with industry needs and standards.' by performing 'Participate in training workshops and industry collaboration projects.' using 'Regular feedback sessions and performance evaluations based on industry benchmarks.' that 'Работодатели' will control. Based on 'Преподаватели' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Эффективно передать знания и объективно оценить студентов. Your current fears: Потерять контроль над процессом обучения из-за новых технологий списывания. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Преподаватели'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by Работодатели with reasoning: While the proposed internship program by 'Работодатели' aims to align assessments with industry needs, it raises concerns about losing control over the educational process and the integrity of assessments. As 'Преподаватели', the focus is on effectively transmitting knowledge and objectively assessing students. The fear of losing control due to new technologies and potential cheating is heightened in a practical setting where assessments are conducted outside the traditional classroom. Thus, the proposal does not sufficiently address the desire for effective knowledge transfer and may exacerbate fears regarding integrity.
We ask 'AI-enabled learning' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'AI-enabled learning', you have been approached by 'Работодатели' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. 'Работодатели' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'AI-enabled learning', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of AI-enabled learning tools for educators and students.' by performing 'Develop and test AI-driven learning modules that adapt to individual learning styles.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiator: Работодатели, Resolution: Develop a dynamic, real-world problem-solving internship program where students are assessed based on their ability to apply knowledge in practical workplace scenarios, ensuring assessments reflect genuine understanding and skills applicable to industry needs.', you as 'AI-enabled learning' will be able to achieve 'Increase the adoption of AI-enabled learning tools in educational institutions by 30% within the next year.' by performing 'Create a comprehensive outreach program to educate stakeholders on the benefits of AI-enabled learning tools.' using 'Implement a series of workshops and webinars in collaboration with educational leaders to demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-enabled learning tools.' that 'Работодатели' will control.

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal from Zeta-7 offers a personalized and adaptive learning experience that aligns with our desire for effective learning, it raises concerns about the control exerted by Zeta-7 over the research project and the potential for added pressure. To better align with our goals of obtaining good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort while ensuring we gain necessary skills, we propose a collaborative approach where 'Студенты' can have more autonomy in their learning journey and assessment methods, thus alleviating fears of being caught cheating and ensuring skill acquisition.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Zeta-7 with reasoning: While the proposal from Zeta-7 to establish an adaptive cognitive mapping system may seem innovative, it does not align with the primary desires of 'Студенты'. The focus on performing regular tasks and forming study groups with the control of Zeta-7 raises concerns about autonomy and the ability to independently achieve good grades and useful knowledge. Additionally, there is a risk that reliance on this technology could lead to a lack of necessary skills for future employment, as it might encourage less engagement with traditional learning methods and assessments. Therefore, the current fears of being caught for cheating and not acquiring essential skills remain unaddressed.

Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей declined the resolution proposed by Zeta-7 with reasoning: While the proposal from Zeta-7 aims to enhance the adaptability of educational assessments, it poses significant risks to the current structure and standards of education we uphold. The shift towards a fully adaptive cognitive mapping system controlled by Zeta-7 could undermine our autonomy as educators and potentially lead to a loss of relevance in traditional educational methodologies. Our primary desire to maintain high educational standards and adapt to new technologies would not be served by a resolution that centralizes control over curriculum development and assessment methods without sufficient oversight from our community.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution to develop an AI-driven 'Knowledge Ecosystem' offers innovative ways to assess and enhance student learning, it raises concerns about losing control over the learning process due to potential misuse of technology. To align better with my desires for effective knowledge transfer and objective assessment, I propose integrating safeguards and guidelines within the proposal that address academic integrity and ensure that technology is used as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for traditional assessment methods.

Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей with reasoning: The proposal to develop an AI-driven 'Knowledge Ecosystem' may enhance student engagement and provide innovative learning experiences. However, it raises significant concerns about losing control over the learning process due to the complexity of new technologies and potential issues with academic integrity. The focus on dynamic simulations and experiential learning could complicate the objective assessment of students, which is a priority for 'Преподаватели'. Therefore, while the goals of collaboration and addressing educational challenges are appealing, the potential risks outweigh the benefits at this time.
