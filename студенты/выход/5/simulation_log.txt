We ask 'Студенты' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Студенты', you have been approached by 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. Currently, 'Студенты' is the initiator of the resolution: 'Использовать технологии искусственного интеллекта для прохождения тестирования'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Студенты', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Improve understanding of course material' by performing 'Participating in study groups and attending lectures'. However, under the proposed resolution '"Создать динамическую систему оценки, основанную на многомерном анализе повседневной учебной деятельности и междисциплинарного сотрудничества, чтобы глубже понимать и учитывать индивидуальные способности и прогресс студентов."', you as 'Студенты' will be able to achieve 'Enhance collaboration with faculty and researchers' by performing 'Engage in joint projects and research initiatives with professors' using 'Establish regular workshops and seminars for collaborative learning and research opportunities' that 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей' will control. Based on 'Студенты' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Получить хорошие оценки и полезные знания с минимальными усилиями. Your current fears: Быть пойманными на списывании или не получить необходимые для будущей работы навыки. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Студенты'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES or NO. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES or NO
	"reasoning": string  // The reasoning behind the participant's decision
}
```.'
Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей with reasoning: The proposed resolution focuses on enhancing collaboration with faculty and researchers through joint projects and research initiatives, which may require significant effort and time commitment. This contradicts the current desire of 'Студенты' to achieve good grades and gain useful knowledge with minimal effort. Additionally, while the initiative aims to provide a deeper understanding of course material, it does not directly address the fear of being caught for academic dishonesty or not acquiring necessary skills for future employment, as it shifts the emphasis away from traditional assessment methods.
We ask 'Преподаватели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Преподаватели', you have been approached by 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'.

```.'
Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to create a dynamic assessment system based on multidimensional analysis of daily learning activities is intriguing and aligns with the desire to effectively convey knowledge and objectively assess students, there are concerns about potential loss of control over the learning process due to new technologies. Therefore, it is important to include measures in the proposal that address the risks of academic dishonesty and ensure that the integrity of the assessment process is maintained. This could be achieved by incorporating safeguards against cheating and promoting academic integrity within the new assessment framework.
We ask 'Преподаватели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Преподаватели', you have been approached by 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy. 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Преподаватели', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance teaching methodologies and share best practices among peers' by performing 'Participating in workshops and collaborative projects'.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed blockchain-based portfolio assessment system has the potential to enhance transparency and authenticity in evaluating student knowledge, it does not fully address my desire for effective knowledge transfer and objective assessment. Additionally, there are concerns about the technology's potential for misuse. I suggest integrating more comprehensive training for faculty and students on how to use this system effectively, ensuring that it complements traditional assessment methods rather than replacing them. This will help maintain control over the learning process while fostering academic integrity.

We ask 'Работодатели' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Работодатели', you have been approached by 'Machine learning classification model' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'Работодатели' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Academic Integrity' with the description: 'Resolution: "Implement a blockchain-based portfolio assessment system that records and verifies a student's ongoing learning processes, achievements, and reflections across diverse contexts, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and a holistic understanding of their knowledge and skills while upholding academic integrity."'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'Machine learning classification model' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Работодатели', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Найти квалифицированных кандидатов для открытых вакансий' by performing 'Публикация вакансий на различных платформах'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiate a dynamic, adaptive learning ecosystem where machine learning models continuously analyze and adjust to individual student learning styles, preferences, and progress, providing real-time, tailored feedback and assessments that truly reflect their knowledge and potential, thus redefining the evaluation paradigm.', you as 'Работодатели' will be able to achieve 'Увеличить точность подбора кандидатов с помощью модели машинного обучения' by performing 'Интегрировать модель машинного обучения в процесс подбора кандидатов' using 'Использовать алгоритмы классификации для анализа резюме и сопоставления их с требованиями вакансий' that 'Machine learning classification model' will control. Based on 'Работодатели' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Нанимать компетентных выпускников с реальными знаниями и навыками. Your current fears: Принять на работу кандидатов, чьи дипломы не отражают их реальных способностей. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Работодатели'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'AI-enabled learning' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'AI-enabled learning', you have been approached by 'teacher' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Существующие методы оценки знаний не отражают реальных знаний студентов'. Currently, 'AI-enabled learning' is a participant in the resolution initiated by 'Machine learning classification model' with the description: 'Initiate a dynamic, adaptive learning ecosystem where machine learning models continuously analyze and adjust to individual student learning styles, preferences, and progress, providing real-time, tailored feedback and assessments that truly reflect their knowledge and potential, thus redefining the evaluation paradigm.'. If you decide to leave this resolution, it may be collapsed due to departure of all participants and you won't be able to get the benefits it provided. 'teacher' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'AI-enabled learning', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'Enhance student engagement through personalized learning experiences.' by performing 'Utilizing AI algorithms to analyze student performance and preferences.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'Initiate a collaborative, student-led knowledge assessment platform where students design and participate in peer-reviewed projects and challenges across disciplines, fostering a community-driven evaluation system that emphasizes creativity, critical thinking, and real-world application of skills.', you as 'AI-enabled learning' will be able to achieve 'Increase overall student achievement by 20% in standardized assessments.' by performing 'Implement adaptive learning technologies that provide tailored resources and assessments.' using 'Regular progress monitoring and feedback loops integrated into the AI system to adjust learning paths accordingly.' that 'teacher' will control. Based on 'AI-enabled learning' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: nan. Your current fears: nan. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'AI-enabled learning'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

```json
{
	"decision": string  // The decision of the participant: YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, MODIFY_PROPOSAL
