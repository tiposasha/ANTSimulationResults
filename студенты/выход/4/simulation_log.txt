Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to use artificial intelligence for testing could create a more engaging learning environment and allow for innovative teaching methods, it raises concerns about maintaining the integrity of the assessment process. To address these fears, the proposal should include safeguards against cheating and ensure that AI tools are used as supplementary aids rather than replacements for traditional assessments. A modified proposal could focus on integrating AI in a way that enhances learning while still preserving the ability to objectively evaluate student knowledge.

Resolution created by Academic Integrity: **Resolution:** Establish a blockchain-based academic integrity system that records and verifies the authenticity of student work and assessments, ensuring transparency and accountability while fostering a culture of trust and genuine learning through peer-reviewed contributions and collaborative knowledge-building.
Recruited participants: ['Студенты', 'Преподаватели', 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей', 'AI-enabled learning']

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Academic Integrity with reasoning: The proposed resolution does not align with the current desires of 'Студенты' to achieve good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort. While the intention to maintain academic integrity is important, the requirement for peer reviews and a blockchain-based system may create additional workload and complexity. This could increase the fear of being caught for academic misconduct, as the scrutiny on originality and adherence to standards may be heightened.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal for a 'Knowledge Exchange Network' aims to enhance student engagement and promote collaborative learning, it raises concerns about maintaining the integrity of assessments and the potential for students to misuse the collaborative aspect. To address these fears and align with the desire for effective knowledge transmission and objective evaluation, the proposal should incorporate mechanisms for monitoring and ensuring that the collaborative work is genuinely reflective of each student's understanding. Additionally, it should include safeguards against academic dishonesty, perhaps through the integration of the blockchain-based system to ensure transparency and accountability in the evaluation of peer contributions.

Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by teacher with reasoning: While the proposed 'Knowledge Exchange Network' promotes collaborative learning and could enhance student engagement, it raises concerns about maintaining control over the learning process. The reliance on peer-to-peer teaching may lead to inconsistent knowledge transmission and assessment accuracy. Additionally, the fear of losing oversight due to new technologies remains unaddressed, as the potential for misuse in a collaborative environment could increase. Thus, the proposal does not sufficiently align with the desire to effectively communicate knowledge and objectively assess students.

Преподаватели declined the resolution proposed by Работодатели with reasoning: While the proposal from 'Работодатели' aims to enhance student engagement and align educational outcomes with industry demands, it raises concerns about 'Преподаватели' losing control over the learning process. The dependency on employer-led initiatives could lead to a compromise in educational integrity and quality, potentially undermining the effective transmission of knowledge and objective assessment of students. Therefore, this proposal does not adequately address the fears of losing control over the educational process.
