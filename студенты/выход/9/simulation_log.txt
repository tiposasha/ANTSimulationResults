Academic Integrity declined the resolution proposed by Survey researchers with reasoning: The proposal from 'Survey Researchers' shifts control of academic integrity education to them, which may dilute the core principles of academic integrity. While the focus on real-time assessment and personalized growth is appealing, it does not align with the foundational objective of fostering a community of trust and accountability among students. Academic Integrity must prioritize maintaining its independence in promoting ethical standards and ensuring that assessments reflect true understanding without compromising its values.
