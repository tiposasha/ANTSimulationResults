Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Perceptions of normative behavior with reasoning: The proposal to initiate a global cultural shift in education through 'Learning Festivals' does not align with my current desires of obtaining good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort. While the collaborative study habits could provide valuable skills, the requirement to participate in group study sessions twice a week may add to the effort and time commitment, which conflicts with my desire for efficiency. Additionally, I fear that this method may not directly lead to good grades, as it relies on diverse community assessments rather than traditional evaluation methods. Therefore, this proposal does not adequately address my needs and concerns.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Perceptions of normative behavior with reasoning: While the proposed 'Behavioral Insight Assessment' system emphasizes practical intelligence and societal impact, it diverges from my current desire to achieve good grades and acquire useful knowledge with minimal effort. The requirement to actively engage in collaborative study groups with structured sessions may increase workload and stress, which contradicts my fear of not acquiring necessary skills and being caught for academic dishonesty. The focus on adaptability and real-world application sounds beneficial, but it seems to place a heavier emphasis on effort and engagement that I am not comfortable with at the moment.
