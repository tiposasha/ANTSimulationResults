Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: AI-enabled learning
Reasoning: AI-enabled learning best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it encapsulates the integration of AI technologies in educational settings, focusing on personalized learning experiences, enhancing human-computer interaction, and fostering creativity and problem-solving skills among students. It addresses both the aspirations for improved educational outcomes through advanced technology and the fears associated with ineffective implementation and potential misuse, making it a comprehensive reflection of the desires and fears articulated.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Academic Integrity
Reasoning: Academic Integrity serves as the central theme that encapsulates the collective desires and fears expressed by the various stakeholders involved. This entity not only reflects the aspirations for honesty, ethical behavior, and a culture of integrity within educational environments but also addresses the concerns of academic dishonesty, cheating, and the erosion of trust among students, faculty, and administrators. By focusing on Academic Integrity, the interests and concerns of parents, teachers, administrators, students, and the broader campus community can be effectively represented and understood.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Survey researchers
Reasoning: Survey researchers best represent the interests and concerns of this group as they are directly involved in gathering accurate data through participant surveys. Their desire for honest and accurate responses aligns with the group's concerns about dishonesty and the implications it has on research outcomes. Furthermore, they navigate fears related to participant honesty and anonymity, making them central to understanding the dynamics of communication, deception, and data integrity across various entities.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: teacher
Reasoning: The teacher represents the interests and concerns of all entities involved in education, including students, universities, and the wider academic community. Teachers are at the forefront of maintaining academic integrity and fostering a culture of honesty while adapting to advancements in technology, such as AI. They have a dual role of educating and inspiring students while also navigating the challenges posed by student cheating and technological changes. Their effectiveness directly impacts students' learning outcomes and the overall reputation of educational institutions.

Resolution created by AI-enabled learning: "Implement adaptive AI-driven learning environments that continuously assess and personalize educational content in real-time, allowing students to demonstrate their understanding through diverse, context-rich challenges rather than traditional testing."
Resolution created by Academic Integrity: Initiator: Academic Integrity, Resolution: "Develop a collaborative knowledge-sharing ecosystem where students co-create assessments with educators, emphasizing peer-reviewed projects and reflective self-assessments that align with real-world applications and ethical guidelines to ensure a comprehensive and honest evaluation of their understanding."

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to leverage survey research techniques to create a dynamic feedback loop between students and educators sounds beneficial in theory, it does not directly align with my current desire to achieve good grades and acquire useful knowledge with minimal effort. Additionally, there is a concern that participating in surveys could distract from my studies or not lead to immediate academic benefits. I would prefer a modified proposal that not only incorporates student feedback but also directly ties the results of that feedback to tangible improvements in assessment methods that allow for better learning outcomes while minimizing the work required on my part.

Преподаватели suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed resolution aims to enhance the assessment process and gather valuable feedback, it raises concerns about maintaining control over the learning process and ensuring academic integrity. To address these fears, I suggest including measures that ensure the integrity of assessments and the feedback loop, such as incorporating secure methods for feedback collection and assessment design that discourage cheating.

Resolution created by Работодатели: Initiator: Работодатели, Resolution: Implement real-world project-based evaluations where students collaborate with industry professionals on actual challenges, providing employers with direct insights into students' practical skills and knowledge application, thus aligning education with workforce needs.
Recruited participants: ['Студенты', 'Сообщество коллег-преподавателей и исследователей', 'AI-enabled learning', 'Survey researchers']

Студенты suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposal to implement real-world project-based evaluations offers an opportunity to gain practical experience and skills, it may not align with the current desire for good grades with minimal effort. Additionally, there is a concern that without proper support and guidance, students might struggle with the practical applications, leading to anxiety about not acquiring necessary skills. A modified proposal should consider integrating a balance between practical evaluations and traditional assessments to ensure that students can still achieve good grades while also gaining real-world experience.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Работодатели with reasoning: While the proposal by 'Работодатели' to implement real-world project-based evaluations offers practical skills and knowledge application that could enhance employability, it does not align with the current desires of 'Студенты' to achieve good grades and useful knowledge with minimal effort. Additionally, the control that 'Работодатели' would have over internships and partnerships raises concerns about the potential for increased pressure and expectations, which could exacerbate fears of not acquiring necessary skills or being caught in academic dishonesty. Therefore, this proposal does not sufficiently address the balance required between academic performance and skill development.

Студенты declined the resolution proposed by Academic Integrity with reasoning: The proposed resolution by 'Academic Integrity' focuses on creating a blockchain-based system for tracking and verifying learning outcomes, which may not directly address the desire for good grades with minimal effort. While maintaining academic integrity is important, the emphasis on transparency and rigorous checks could increase the pressure on students, making it harder to achieve good grades without extensive effort. Additionally, the fear of being caught for dishonesty might remain if the focus is solely on compliance with plagiarism detection systems instead of fostering genuine learning and understanding.
