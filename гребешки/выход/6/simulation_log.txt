Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: French consumer
Reasoning: The French consumer best represents the interests and concerns of the group because they are directly linked to the demand for seafood, including sea scallops. Their desires for high-quality seafood delicacies and fears about the availability and price of scallops reflect the broader ecological and economic dynamics at play. The consumer's actions influence fishing practices, sustainability efforts, and ultimately the relationship between the various actors in the ecosystem, including mollusks and XG-9. By understanding the consumer's perspective, we gain insights into the interconnected desires and fears of all entities involved.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Scallops
Reasoning: Scallops, as mature organisms, encapsulate the desires and fears of the entire lifecycle from larvae to adult stages. They represent the culmination of the attachment and growth processes, as well as the successful reproduction efforts that are critical for the restoration of the bay's population. Their existence reflects the success or failure of the earlier stages (larvae) and the environmental conditions they face, thus embodying the concerns about population restoration, attachment to substrates, and the influence of external factors.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Translation
Reasoning: Translation serves as a crucial intermediary that facilitates communication and understanding between different actors, including society, nature, fishermen, and marine organisms. This entity embodies the desire to accurately represent the interests and voices of various groups, while also addressing fears of misinterpretation and disconnection from actual needs. By focusing on translation, we can foster social cohesion and stability, maintain harmony in interactions, and ensure that the complexities of both human activities and ecological systems are effectively communicated.

Resolution created by French consumer: As a 'French consumer', propose a resolution to transform the scallop market by promoting and investing in the development of sustainable aquaculture farms that utilize eco-friendly technologies and involve local communities in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc, ensuring both ecological balance and economic growth.
Resolution created by Scallops: As 'Scallops', propose a resolution to implement a blockchain-based traceability system that incentivizes sustainable harvesting practices by rewarding fishermen with higher market prices for verifiably sustainable catches, while simultaneously using AI-driven marine drones to monitor and protect scallop populations in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc.
Resolution created by Translation: As 'Translation', propose a resolution to establish an international collaborative platform that leverages multilingual AI to facilitate real-time communication and knowledge exchange between global marine scientists, local fishermen, and policymakers, ensuring adaptive and culturally-sensitive strategies for sustainable scallop harvesting in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc.

Resolution created by Scallops: 'Scallops' proposes the creation of a blockchain-based scallop conservation and trading platform that rewards sustainable harvesting practices with cryptocurrency incentives, enabling transparent tracking of scallop populations and empowering local communities to monitor and manage their resources effectively.
Recruited participants: ['Три исследователя', 'Рыбаки', 'Морские гребешки', 'French consumer']
We ask 'Три исследователя' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Три исследователя', you have been approached by 'Scallops' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Проблема устойчивой добычи сокращающейся популяции гребешков в заливе Сен-Брие'.
