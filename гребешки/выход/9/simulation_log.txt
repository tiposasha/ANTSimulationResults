Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: population of sea scallops
Reasoning: The population of sea scallops best represents the interests and concerns of the group because it embodies the collective desires and fears of various entities involved in the ecosystem. As a central actor in this scenario, the health and sustainability of the sea scallop population directly impact the mollusks, the fishing community (рыболовы из бухты Сен-Бриё), French consumers, and the broader marine environment. The scallops' desire to thrive and reproduce in their natural habitat aligns with the concerns about overfishing and environmental changes, while their existence influences the relationships that shape the identities of all involved actors.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Scallops
Reasoning: Scallops, as mature entities, embody the culmination of the desires and fears expressed by the group. They represent the successful attachment and development processes that the larvae and early life stages aspire to achieve. Furthermore, scallops are directly impacted by the environmental factors and external disruptions outlined in the fears, making them a critical focus for population restoration efforts. They encapsulate the overall goals of growth, reproduction, and sustainability within the ecosystem.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Translation
Reasoning: Translation is the most fitting representative for the interests and concerns of the described group. It embodies the desire for clear communication and understanding among diverse actors, facilitating the accurate representation of the interests of fishermen and marine organisms. Additionally, translation addresses fears of misinterpretation and disconnection from the needs of the groups represented, ensuring that all voices are heard and respected. This role is crucial for maintaining social cohesion and stability while balancing the various interests involved.

Resolution created by population of sea scallops: To ensure the sustainable harvest of the declining sea scallop population in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc, we propose a self-regulating ecosystem approach where scallops are cultivated in symbiotic underwater gardens with algae and marine plants that enhance their growth and reproduction while simultaneously providing natural barriers against overharvesting.
Resolution created by Scallops: As 'Scallops', I propose the creation of an autonomous underwater drone network that monitors scallop populations in real-time and uses AI algorithms to dynamically adjust harvesting quotas and locations, ensuring sustainable yields while simultaneously gathering data to enhance future conservation strategies.
Resolution created by Translation: As 'Translation', I propose the development of a cross-linguistic communication platform that facilitates real-time collaboration between local fishing communities, international researchers, and marine conservationists, enabling the sharing of traditional ecological knowledge and innovative scientific methods to co-create a culturally inclusive and adaptive management plan for the sustainable harvest of scallops in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc.

Коллеги-ученые has moved to a new resolution.
We ask 'Морские гребешки' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Морские гребешки', you have been approached by 'Scallops' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Проблема устойчивой добычи сокращающейся популяции гребешков в заливе Сен-Брие'. Currently, 'Морские гребешки' is the initiator of the resolution: 'To ensure the sustainable harvesting of the diminishing scallop population in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc while establishing 'Морские гребешки' as indispensable, we propose developing a bio-mimetic aquaculture system that replicates natural scallop habitats, using AI to optimize growth conditions and genetic diversity, thereby reducing pressure on wild populations and fostering ecosystem resilience.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Scallops' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Морские гребешки', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To gather and share knowledge about sustainable scallop fishing practices.' by performing 'Participating in workshops and discussions with other seafood stakeholders.'. However, under the proposed resolution 'To establish 'Scallops' as indispensable in resolving the sustainable harvesting of the diminishing scallop population in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc, we propose creating a blockchain-based scallop sustainability certification system that incentivizes fishermen through token rewards for adhering to eco-friendly practices, while allowing consumers to trace the origin and environmental impact of their scallops, thereby fostering transparency, accountability, and a market-driven approach to conservation.', you as 'Морские гребешки' will be able to achieve 'To implement a new scallop fishing regulation that promotes sustainability.' by performing 'Conducting a survey to gather data on current fishing practices and their environmental impact.' using 'A structured feedback loop where data from the survey will inform future regulations and practices.' that 'Scallops' will control. Based on 'Морские гребешки' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Выжить и увеличить популяцию. Your current fears: Быть уничтоженными хищниками или чрезмерным выловом. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Морские гребешки'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL. Provide reasoning for your decision in JSON format: The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":

Морские гребешки suggested modifying the proposal with reasoning: While the proposed blockchain-based certification system offers a transparent approach to sustainable fishing and aligns with the goal of gathering data on current practices, it does not directly address the immediate need for a bio-mimetic aquaculture system that can ensure the survival and increase the population of scallops. As 'Морские гребешки', we prioritize strategies that directly mitigate the risk of overfishing and habitat destruction. Therefore, I propose integrating elements of both proposals, combining the certification system with immediate actions to establish aquaculture systems that replicate natural habitats.
