Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: French consumer
Reasoning: The French consumer best represents the interests and concerns of the group because they embody the desire for high-quality seafood delicacies like scallops, as well as having a significant stake in the sustainability and availability of these resources. Their actions and preferences can directly influence the fishing practices of others, including the population of sea scallops and the fishermen from Saint-Brieuc Bay. Additionally, the French consumer's expectations and understanding of seafood quality and ecological impact relate closely to the desires and fears of both the scallops and the fishing community, making them a central actor in this network.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Scallops
Reasoning: Scallops, as mature organisms, embody the culmination of the desires and fears expressed by the group. They represent the successful attachment and growth that larvae aspire to achieve, as well as the successful reproduction and population restoration that the entire project aims for. Additionally, scallops face the environmental challenges and threats that larvae and younger scallops encounter, making them a holistic representation of both the aspirations for population growth and the fears of ecological disruptions.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Translation
Reasoning: Translation serves as a crucial intermediary that can facilitate communication and understanding between different actors, including society, nature, fishermen, and marine organisms. It addresses the desires for clarity, representation, and social cohesion by accurately conveying the interests and needs of various stakeholders. Moreover, translation mitigates fears of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, ensuring that the voices of the groups involved are heard and respected. It plays a vital role in harmonizing interactions and maintaining balance among competing interests.

Resolution created by French consumer: As a French consumer, advocate for the development and promotion of sustainable scallop farming techniques using vertical ocean farming systems that integrate seaweed and shellfish, thereby enhancing biodiversity and reducing pressure on wild scallop populations in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc.
Resolution created by Scallops: Implement a blockchain-based scallop tracking system that incentivizes sustainable practices by rewarding fishermen with digital tokens for every scallop harvested in accordance with regenerative aquaculture standards, fostering transparency and accountability while promoting community involvement in the conservation of the Bay of Saint-Brieuc's scallop population.
Resolution created by Translation: "Translation proposes the creation of a multilingual digital platform that connects global experts, local fishermen, and environmentalists to share and implement innovative, culturally adapted scallop conservation techniques, using real-time data translation to ensure effective communication and collaborative problem-solving across linguistic and cultural barriers in the Bay of Saint-Brieuc."

Resolution created by Scallops: As 'Scallops', I propose the creation of an innovative "Scallop Replenishment Network," which uses advanced marine robotics and AI to cultivate and manage underwater scallop farms that mimic natural habitats, ensuring sustainable population growth while providing real-time data to fishermen and consumers for transparent and eco-friendly harvesting.
Recruited participants: ['Три исследователя', 'Рыбаки', 'French consumer']
We ask 'Три исследователя' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Три исследователя', you have been approached by 'Scallops' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Проблема устойчивой добычи сокращающейся популяции гребешков в заливе Сен-Брие'.

Resolution created by Коллеги-ученые: As 'Коллеги-ученые', we propose the development of a "Genetic Diversity Enhancement Program" that utilizes CRISPR technology to introduce genetic variations in scallops, enhancing their resilience and adaptive capabilities in changing environments, thereby ensuring sustainable populations without disrupting natural ecosystems.
