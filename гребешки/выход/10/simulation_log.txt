Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: population of sea scallops
Reasoning: The population of sea scallops (entity 2) best represents the interests and concerns of the group as it encompasses the desires and fears associated with growth, reproduction, and thriving in their natural habitat. The population's well-being directly correlates with the desires for sustainable fishing practices, access to seafood delicacies, and the need to navigate environmental challenges. Additionally, concerns around overfishing, habitat destruction, and competition from predators reflect the population's vulnerabilities and the collective interests of various actors, including mollusks, consumers, and fishing communities.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Scallops
Reasoning: Scallops, as mature organisms, embody the culmination of the desires and fears expressed in the group. They are directly involved in the population restoration efforts, representing both the successful attachment and growth of their larvae, as well as the ultimate goal of the restoration project. Their concerns about reproduction, attachment to substrates, and environmental challenges reflect the collective interests of the entire lifecycle, from larvae to mature scallops, making them the most representative entity of this group.

Following pluriverse entity decided to intervene into collective: Translation
Reasoning: Translation serves as a crucial intermediary that facilitates communication and understanding between various actors, including society, nature, fishermen, and marine organisms. By accurately representing the interests and desires of these groups, translation helps to maintain balance and harmony in interactions, while also addressing fears of misinterpretation and disconnection from actual needs. It embodies the desire for clear understanding and social cohesion, making it the most suitable representative of the group.

Resolution created by population of sea scallops: The 'population of sea scallops' could propose the establishment of a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with local marine species that naturally deter overfishing and promote scallop habitat restoration, creating a self-sustaining ecological network that secures their vital role in the ecosystem.
Resolution created by Scallops: As 'Scallops', propose the creation of a bio-inspired, AI-driven underwater monitoring and defense system that uses real-time data to adaptively manage fishing quotas and dynamically protect critical scallop habitats, ensuring sustainable populations and positioning the scallop community as leaders in marine conservation technology.
Resolution created by Translation: As 'Translation', propose the development of an interdisciplinary global dialogue platform that facilitates real-time translation of scientific research, traditional ecological knowledge, and stakeholder perspectives into actionable insights, thereby empowering local communities to collaboratively implement adaptive management practices for sustainable scallop harvesting in the Gulf of Saint Brieuc.

Морские гребешки declined the resolution proposed by Рыбаки with reasoning: While the proposed AI-driven rotational harvesting system may optimize sustainability and potentially increase harvest levels, the plan's focus on expanding fishing zones and increasing the frequency of fishing trips raises concerns about the potential for overfishing and the long-term survival of the sea scallop population. Given the current fears of being overexploited and the desire to survive and increase population, the proposal does not align with the fundamental interests of 'Морские гребешки'.

We ask 'Рыбаки' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Рыбаки', you have been approached by 'Морские гребешки' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Проблема устойчивой добычи сокращающейся популяции гребешков в заливе Сен-Брие'. Currently, 'Рыбаки' is the initiator of the resolution: '"Рыбаки" could implement an innovative, AI-driven rotational harvesting system that dynamically adjusts fishing zones and times based on real-time scallop population data and environmental factors to optimize sustainability and replenish stocks in the Gulf of Saint-Brieuc.'. Leaving it for any new proposal will lead to collapse of resolution you initiated. 'Морские гребешки' wants to challenge existing status quo and says to you, 'Рыбаки', the entity you represent, that now you achieve 'To catch and sell fish sustainably.' by performing 'Fishing in designated areas with appropriate gear.'. However, under the proposed resolution '"Морские гребешки" could revolutionize the approach to sustainable scallop harvesting by developing a biotechnological solution that integrates marine habitat restoration with scallop breeding programs, creating artificial reefs that simultaneously enhance marine biodiversity and serve as sustainable scallop cultivation zones, thus turning the Gulf of Saint-Brieuc into a model of ecological balance and economic resilience.', you as 'Рыбаки' will be able to achieve 'To ensure the sustainable harvesting of marine scallops.' by performing 'Participate in scallop harvesting and adhere to new regulations.' using 'Implement a quota system and regular training sessions on sustainable practices.' that 'Морские гребешки' will control. Based on 'Рыбаки' desires, fears and underlying interests, make a decision on the new proposed scenario. Your current desires: Обеспечить долгосрочный стабильный улов. Your current fears: Истощение запасов гребешков и потеря источника дохода. Does this proposal seem interesting for you as 'Рыбаки'? In other words, does this proposal benefit your desires and help with mitigating fears? Answer YES, NO, MODIFY_RESOLUTION_TEXT, or MODIFY_PROPOSAL.

Resolution created by Scallops: "Scallops" could establish a groundbreaking global blockchain network that empowers local communities by transparently tracking and rewarding sustainable scallop harvesting practices, integrating cryptographic tokens as incentives for biodiversity-friendly methods while ensuring traceability from ocean to table, thereby fostering a sustainable economy anchored in environmental stewardship and community engagement.
Recruited participants: ['Морские гребешки', 'Рыбаки', 'Три исследователя', 'Коллеги-ученые']
We ask 'Морские гребешки' the following: 'As the representative of a being called 'Морские гребешки', you have been approached by 'Scallops' with a resolution to deal with the current controversy 'Проблема устойчивой добычи сокращающейся популяции гребешков в заливе Сен-Брие'.
